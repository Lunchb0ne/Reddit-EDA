f9outu,Fuck all Religion,17891,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Like in the USA, and now India, which emulates them. \n\nUnless a country offers free world class education and healthcare, this gap will only increase. Most European countries that offer these don’t have such a yawning gap between the rich and poor. Tax money is used to give free education and healthcare of a very high degree of quality. \n\nWhen free quality education is lacking, opportunities to the poor are denied because the rich will send their children to the good schools, and will obviously have a head start over their poor counterparts for quality jobs. And the rich-poor gap will only increase. But if the poor were to receive the same (and free) quality education, they will be able to compete on a equal footing, and this gap will slowly reduce. \n\nHealthcare is a major financial burden when people get seriously ill. The rich have access to the best healthcare, and they can afford it. The not-so-well off will see a major chunk of their savings shaved off if they fall seriously ill. Only a free quality healthcare system will allow them to not worry about this expense head. But as things stand today, here too we are copying the USA system of healthcare (one of the worst in the western world), where the insurance companies make all the money, and yet this is denied to the poor. \n\nOur tax money needs to go into these two heads if the country’s rich-poor divide is to reduce.

**Background Reading**

* [Kodaikanal mercury poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal_mercury_poisoning)
* [Unilever's Mercury Fever](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=624)

The summary of these articles would be as follows,

A company called Ponds moved its thermometer factory from the US to Kodaikanal in 1982.

HLL took over Ponds, ran operations till 2001.

A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.

What has been ignored because of lack of visibility is the plight of my village (which I will not name). My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.

I have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 

If you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.

I want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO's...ideas are welcome.

Further studies in case you are interested.

[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).

>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 µg/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 µg/kg and 8.3 µg/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.

>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That's no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.

This article talks about a town 130 Km's away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km's by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn't matter to us. 

Edit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don't want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.

edit 2 - Guys, have received PM's from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.

To be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.

edit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.

I will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.

Thank you.

These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a “daredevil selfie” when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. 

The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.

**Actual Events:**

Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. 
The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngsters’ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.

**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.

All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. 

I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.


This is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. 

For Pranita.

Edit: Guys please, if something here offends you then please let me know, but please do not downvote this, we dont want her to be remembered this way, we want to get the true story out.

Thankyou guys so much once again, and thanks to the mods for being so cooperative. Thankyou ScoopWhoop for owning up to the mistake and not ignoring the truth when it came out. This post is now being circulated all over facebook and my college thanks to the efforts of reddit India.
 
 To Pranita, 
I hope you are in a better place, the college will forever miss seeing your radiating smile everyday.

To those reading, the best thing to do in honour of Pranitas memory is to ensure such places carry warning signs alerting visitors of dangers, as suggested by a redditor [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4m5l2k/my_friend_passed_away_and_toi_made_a_mockery_of/d3t7u30?context=3)

**EDIT:** As of 12PM IST (3rd June)  all the major newshouses have now either taken down the incorrect version, or posted the correct version. I will most likely stop updating this post, unless something major happens. 

Pls also note that I haven't disclosed my identity to anybody **not even to people in my college.**

Till now, only Indian Express has done the most in depth coverage and brought forth the true story, **I urge you all to read from [This Link](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/law-student-who-died-a-selfie-death-of-media-didnt-even-have-her-phone-with-her-2833051/ )**


Thanks to everyone on reddit, you guys have done something of immense value today.  I wish you guys all the best in life.

The project was funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  and IIT Bombay. Powai Labs, a Mumbai-based company, has also invested in the venture and will own, market and support the product. \n\n> AJIT’s features can be compared to many of the microprocessors of its size available in today’s market. Unlike the ones used in the desktops like the Intel’s Xeon, AJIT is a medium-sized processor. It can be used inside a set-top box, as a control panel for automation systems, in a traffic light controller or even robotic systems. What’s more, the researchers expect that AJIT will cost as less as ₹100 when it is produced en-masse. \n\n> AJIT can run one instruction per clock cycle and can operate at clock speeds between 70-120MHz, comparable to its competitors in the market.\n\n> “We have been working on this processor design for more than two years now. The design has been tested on programmable semiconductor chips before we began our effort towards fabricating the processor,” says Prof. Desai\n\n> The researchers have made the software tools associated with AJIT freely available to everyone. The processor is also available as a ‘softcore’, where vendors can buy a license to use the design of the microprocessor and fabricate it to use it in their system. The researchers also offer to customise the processor for specific applications.\n\n\nThere is a lot more info in the article.', 'ELI5 how it is different from other processors and where IITB is planning to use it?', 'Any RISC while using this?', 'Can it run Crysis????', 'Whats next?

Only 13 out of 1000 marriages result in a divorce in India. 
It could be due to arranged marriages, society pressure and the stigma attached to it. Most importantly it is because of the financial dependence.

Let’s see.\n\nMad price discovery mechanisms in big Indian cities like Noida, Mumbai and Delhi.\n\nTo understand what has happened, let’s imagine there is a piece of land somewhere in Noida or Mumbai.\n\n\n\nThere are two parties willing to buy the land - one is a farmer, the other is a property developer.\n\nAs the demand for property in the market is much higher than the demand for food, the property developer is able to pay a higher interest rate to the bank.\xa0In other words, the property developer has a probability of making higher profits from the land than the farmer.\n\nNow, one might say there is nothing wrong here. But to see what’s wrong, we need to ask\xa0Why is the demand of property so high?\n\nThe simple people would say it’s because the population is growing, and land is limited, so the demand for property is high and growing.\n\nBut if you dig deep, you realise there are two reasons the demand of property is high in our country.\xa0Based on the reason causing the demand, we can divide the demand for property into two - the organic demand and the speculation driven demand.\n\nWhen people buy house to live in, it’s organic demand. But\xa0when people buy houses not to live, but to make money, it’s speculation driven demand.\n\nSo the demand for property in big cities of India is not high because people want to live and for that they need houses, the demand for properties is high because people are buying multiple properties to earn money.\n\nLet’s go back to our example - as the demand for property is artificially high, the property developer can make a lot of money from the land.\xa0The banks (or other funds) want to earn money as well, so they give loan not to the farmer, but to the property developer.\n\nThis ruins the economy in multiple ways -\xa0First, it increases the artificial demand for land and property even more, driving the cycle further. Second, it creates supply of things without organic demand. Big buildings are being constructed but the working class of our country can’t afford the houses, specially in big cities.\xa0The law of supply-and-demand has been killed due to the speculation driven artificial liquidity injection.\xa0Third, it increases the wealth gap by boosting asset prices. Forth, because the banks are more willing to fund speculative investments instead of real economic activity, the employment creation is low in the long run. So you see this gap between GDP Growth and employment in India.\xa0Fifth, the Indian banks are dead inside. We will see this in next point.\n\nIndian Banks are toast\n\nGoing back to our example - the bank has now given loan to the property developer. Everything looks fine they will say. What can go wrong?\n\nThe health of the bank look really nice. They have an asset paying them 6%. And in case the property developer fails, the bank can always take over the property and sell it, recovering all the money.\xa0Nothing can go wrong. It’s all safe. Right? NO.\n\nRemember the two types of demand - the organic demand and speculation driven demand.\n\n\n\nSee the cycle described above. You will see why Indian banks are finished. Everything is fine until it’s not.\xa0Suddenly there will be an explosion in the banking system, banks will start failing one after the other.\n\nRemember the high property prices were created by the money injections by the banks (and private funds) themselves.\xa0The banks fund the purchase and development of properties.\n\nIndian banks are already in trouble. This cycle has started, it will take some more time to blow up. You wouldn't see this till it’s too late.\n\n\n\nThat’s why we have unfinished property crisis in big cities, the developers can’t borrow more to finish the development.\n\nWhat do we learn here -\xa0The property prices are not going up because of lack of land or growing population, but due to money being injected into the system by reckless banks.\n\nHow careless banks created the job crisis of India - why India can’t create massive scale, permanent good paying jobs for its youth.\n\nLet’s go back to our example. The farmer was unable to get the loan and land not because what he was doing was useless, it was because his industry didn’t had a banking system and speculative investors creating artificial demand.\n\nIf he owned the land, he would be producing food for the people living in the area. Not only did the bank’s and investors’ careless practices increased the housing and land prices in the area, it also kicked out the other productive people and entrepreneurs from the locality.\n\nIn an ideal case, the bank should be lending to various sectors of the economy. This would increase production of useful goods and services and increase the prosperity of the locality.\n\nBut because of the bank’s incentive to earn a lot of money, they give a lot of loan to a few people, in a few cities, in a few industries. This increase wealth inequality.\n\nSo the farmer that could have created a good agri business and good productive jobs for a lot of people is now himself working as a real-estate agent.\n\nAnd what happens when the property bubble goes bust? The people working in the industry will lose jobs. All the workers, labourers, will be out of work.\n\nSo the banks are, instead of creating long term productive jobs, funding the creation of temporary jobs in speculative industries, while harming entrepreneurs by increasing the cost of borrowing and running a business.\n\nSo you see the GDP is going up, Sensex is up but employment is not.\n\nWhy government is pushing for a cashless economy?\n\nCause the banks are toast. As soon as banking system goes down, everyone will start pulling cash out of the bank, creating what we call a “bank run”.\nBank’s don’t have the cash to pay everyone, cause they give out the cash in loans. They take deposits from you, keep a tiny part of it as reserves and give out the rest as loans.\n\nSo if everyone starts pulling out their money from the bank all at once, banks will explode, as they don’t have money.\n\nThe solution? Cashless economy !\n\nDid you notice,\xa0there is no way for someone to get out of the banking system in a 100% cashless economy.Your money will always be in the banking system. Money can only move from one account to another. You can never pull your money out of the banking system.\n\nModi is pushing for a cashless economy to keep you trapped in the banking system.\xa0The banking system is dead inside and needs your money to survive.\n\nDemonetisation was done to push the money outside the banking system into the system. Demonetisation was done to protect the banks.\n\n\n\nGovernment’s Big Scam - The taxpayer bailout of careless rich people\n\n\n\nThe Modi government is using your tax money to bail-out the careless banks, private investors and rich big-city home buyers.\n\nIt’s a scam. The Indian government is stealing your money, and you are happy because Modi is destroying Pakistan.\xa0Only thing these guys are destroying is your money.\n\nHer argument is “I want to help the home buyers”\n\nIf these home-buyers earn money, does the common tax payers get that money? No.\nSo if these people face losses, why should the tax payer take the hit?\n\nPrivatised profits and socialised losses. Whenever something terrible happens, this lady is always involved.\n\nMumbai and Delhi are toast\n\n\nWhat you can do -\n\nStop making rich people rich. Stop watching movies. Stop buying luxurious things. Stop feeding the monster.\n\nDon’t keep your money in small banks.\n\nBuy local things, or things made by small and mid-size companies.\n\nBuy only what’s needed.\n\nDon’t waste your time watching mainstream media. Mainstream media is not journalism, it’s an advertisement driven industry. It’s an industry, it works for money.\n\nLearn fundamental-analysis before investing.\n\nSave good amounts of your money in hard cash, gold and silver.\n\nRead books, educate yourself.\n\nHave the habit of a non-materialistic life. Once this system falls, everyone will have to live simple life.\n\n\n\nDon’t be tempted by what you see on TV and Instagram\n\nEdit : Some more arguments that I saw (just pasting them here)\n\nA1 :  I am truly grateful to meet one more person who is able to see beyond the veils! \nif you observe closely, a lot of this NPA crisis had started showing up publicly after the demonetization saga!\n\nA2 : from your reply what i noticed is you only mentioned that banking system was about to collapse and then Modi did the demonitozation to save it, lets say he wouldnt have done it, then you only here thrashing him for not doing anything, and if he does then also same, atleast he is doing something, trying different options, what other government did, the property prices peaked during 2004 to 2014, after modi govt came they mandatory to linked the property to aadhar cards, they mandate the rera now a days property prices are stable for quite a some time, what you mentioned is true and should be avoided but instead of blaming the current govt we should blame ourselves too, we all are selfish, we all want free things, we all dont want to work and find a simplest way to rich overnight, do you really think a farmer would be happy to do farming instead of being a property dealer where he has nothing to do."", 'History will be kinder to me...he said 5 years ago.

I was privileged enough to be able to play but not to pursue,  education doesn't exactly go well with sports and Indian parents in our country, Our coach tried his best to raise awareness and setup small funds from the local shops but in a small town there's only so much you can do, People like these gets lost in the never ending rat race of survival in our country and talents don't get a platform or a chance to prove themselves or gets exposure to actually do anything, be it in training or development. \n\nWe still do not have mentality to attend or endure whole season of football, Let alone the I League. Community Shield etc. ISL is only for a short period of time and tbf it's doing more wrong than good, but still the initiative is good, as no one else fucking bothers.\n\nI still hope one day indian kids will dream of playing football for our country / clubs abroad and people will get behind their players like they do for cricket now.\n\nEdit: retarded typos."", 'A sight to see.. I’d pay to watch this ... tired of paying big bucks to watch euro friendlies.', ""Football is slowly picking up pace in India. With so many young kids attracted to club football in Europe and better focus on training facilities, India will slowly improve its standing. But it's still a long way to go, maybe 10-15 years before we get to the top 50 rankings.""]",Sports

7xqpyb,Hi r/India! I wanted to share this piece I finished this morning of my granduncle in Punjab,2950,,https://i.imgur.com/qvl8o1p.jpg,"['""Beyond every bend""\noil on canvas\n36""x36""\n\nThis is painting of my granduncle who I visit almost every year in India. He has always been a very cheerful and jolly man, almost like my own santa growing up.  During my recent visit in 2016, he was not the same.  He would often come around the village with his grandchildren around his shoulders. This time I would go to visit him, in a small room on the side of the road. The room was connected to the larger family house but there was a sense of isolation and exclusion there. \n\nI think he was alone, away from his family. He had lost about 50 lbs and was not able to communicate any sort of happy expression. He sat up when he saw me but deep down, there was an underlying loneliness I could relate to. It was almost like he was just waiting for the end.\n\nI can relate to that deep sense of not belonging and often try to communicate it through some of my portraiture. It is in many ways baffling to me how we can be moving inward together, at the same time, not knowing we are not going through it alone.  Unfortunately, I feel at times my culture has been a factor in that. Things are often unsaid and misunderstood. I\'ve grown up not knowing how to express internal conflict and struggle because it just wasn\'t something practiced at the family table. Eventually I would like to create enough work for exhibits and to bring some light to issues of mental health to the general public but also to my own culture.   \n\nThe goal of the painting was to portray the overall mood so I started the painting with a large brush to cover the initial layer. 99% of the painting after that was in palette knife. The knife allows me to create movement, texture, and atmosphere in a few sessions instead of having to layer with a brush.', ""I don't know why but this reminds me so much of [this image](http://www.culturalindia.net/iliimages/Bhagat-Singh-ili-24-img-5.jpg) of Bhagat Singh"", 'Always loved the Punjabi getup and persona, your granduncle and your painting really personified both!

(Source: Twitter) Twitter has been buzzing with reactions to the news, with some saying that what the officer did was to be expected and should not be hailed as an achievement, while others lauded the policeman’s decision. (Source: Twitter)\n\nA policeman’s job in India is not an easy one. And though the police force is there to protect and help the citizens of this country – and they do so as well – there are times when they find themselves in a fix when dealing with VIPs. How many times have we seen policemen and women being hauled up for not giving preferential treatment to a bureaucrat or politician and the incident being caught on camera. Well, such problems don’t stop these lawmen from doing their duty, and one such example was of a Bengaluru traffic police officer, who stopped the President’s convoy so that an ambulance could pass through.\n\nTraffic police sub-inspector ML Nijalingappa, who was deployed at Bengaluru’s Trinity Circle on Saturday (June 17), has won hearts in the city and on social media alike for making way for an ambulance even as a convoy of the President of India was to pass through a busy junction. According to an ANI report, the Bengaluru Police later announced a reward for the policeman for making way for an ambulance during the convoy movement of President Pranab Mukherjee, who was in the city for the inauguration of Metro’s Green Line.\n\nMukherjee’s convoy was headed towards the Raj Bhavan when Nijalingappa is said to have spotted an ambulance trying to make its a way towards a private hospital near HAL. The sub-inspector directed his colleagues to help the ambulance travel through the traffic-heavy road.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic East Division, Bengaluru City, Abhei Goyal later took to Twitter to praise the officer’s presence of mind.\n\nPSI Sh Nijlingappa is rewarded for deftly allowing the ambulance before the 1st citizen of India. @blrcitytraffic gives way to ??, do you? pic.twitter.com/KoI2nap14N — DCP Traffic East (@DCPTrEastBCP) June 18, 2017\n\nPraveen Sood, the Commissioner of Police, tweeted, “The policeman who took such initiative to be rewarded.

87f85p,My relatives visited me. And I live with my girlfriend unbeknownst to them. And they lost their shit. And it was a thing of beauty. (Re-posting because violated some rules earlier),2586,"Backstory: Last week I broke my ankle and there's a cast around it.  
And also, I tend to be one of the lucky guys in India who lives with his girlfriend. But also unlucky in the sense that a handful of my relatives also live in Delhi.

Here's a highlight of how my last 5 days have been when they visited

* Initially I had to endure gasps, shudders and shivers of them when they realize about my ""Living arrangement"" and how ""apposit Jendaars"" are not supposed to live together.

* Then I experienced a satisfaction almost equal to 1/10th of an orgasm when I saw their faces while they ""inform"" my dad(who couldn't give two shits about it. He's cool like that.)

* Then some other bullshit was uttered around me about homeopathy, patanjali or some pehelwan in some gali or chowk who can cure me within a minute.

* Then came a 2nd wave of gasps and horrific squeals when they realized there is no temple or statue at home.

* In the evening my girlfriend comes from work, so naturally my relatives **HAD** to know what her parents do, earn, spend, overpronate, underpronate???

* Then when they were checking out the rest of the house and saw that the bedroom is being shared (and this is the best part) they acted as if I've murdered their children.

* My bua also got disgusted when she found out I was washing both of ours clothes as it is *ladies* work (This is the only time I was legit pissed) 

* My gf has a full sleeve tattoo for which my maami had a questionnaire ready

* Honb'l mention- It was Navratri and the maid had prepared chicken and rice in Lunch so that was fun.

* Another honb'l mention: All of them know that I drink. Because I got many of my cousins drunk in a family wedding some years back. But when they found the bottles and asked me whether she drinks or not and when I said yes she does. Their immediate response was *But girls can't drink.*  
As if it's anatomically impossible for chicks to drink alcohol.

And I am 24 btw. Just for perspective for how ridiculous they are.

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way

* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.

* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan

* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries. [Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistan](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bangladesh-india-citizenship-amendment-bill-pak-afghanistan-modi-hasina-1628304-2019-12-14)


>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

In short, the act is discriminatory in nature as it clearly states that India is only interested in taking non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Coupled with NRC, CAA will create a hostile environment for Indian Muslims where they will be at the complete mercy of the government.", ,"['If you are an Indian muslim and you have documents dating before 2014 proving your presence in India (say, birth certificate or passport), will you also have to prove your citizenship then?', ""My father just stated today that India shouldn't have been made secular.\n\nWhen i asked him what should be done with jains, sikhs and Buddhists, he replied that they are a part of Hindus.\n\nNo answer for Christians or parsies or Jews but wanted Muslims out of India."", 'Random observation: this whole CAB seems to be like a weird attempt to introduce something in India similar to what Israel does, called Aliyah (the right of return to the land of Israel that any Jew in the world can do):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah)', 'Please pin this on the first page as FAQ.

The CAA does not amend or alter it in any manner whatsoever. Hundreds of Muslims migrating from these three countries have been granted Indian citizenship during the last few years. If found eligible, all such future migrants shall also get Indian citizenship, irrespective of their numbers or religion. In 2014, after the settlement of Indo-Bangladesh boundary issues, 14,864 Bangladeshi citizens were given the Indian Citizenship when their enclaves were incorporated into the territory of India.

Wouldn't a lot of people be eligible at least to acquire citizenship by naturalization? As far as I know, the 1955 act applies to every person irrespective of their religion. Only the CAA lays out a special condition for non-muslim migrants from three countries, that of a reduced time (five years) to be eligible for naturalization.\n\nThe purpose of the NRC would be to make sure that everybody tagged as an Indian citizen has the documented proofs that establishes at least one of the four principal requirements under the 1955 act, namely Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization.\n\nFor example, one of the proofs would be something that can establish that you have been a resident of India for 12 years, so that you're eligible for citizenship by naturalization. My understanding is that it's not that hard to demonstrate that you have been resident in India for twelve years for most people.\n\nIt might be hard for the homeless but wouldn't that be a problem for everybody? Including non-muslims who aren't migrants? Because the CAA only applies to non-muslims **who are also** migrants from those three countries and have been a resident of India since at least 31 December 2014.\n\nAnd even if you don't have documented proof there are other provisions [such as  witnesses or local proofs supported by members of the community, as clarified by the MHA Spokesperson yesterday](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-indian-will-have-to-prove-ancestry-common-documents-will-be-enough-mha-1630201-2019-12-20).\n\nI think that people might be confusing the Assam NRC process for the one that will be implemented nationwide. The Assam NRC guidelines were laid out by the Supreme Court in 2015 specifically for Assam and as of today no official guideline, or process or procedure exists for the nationwide NRC exercise.\n\nSo I'm not sure if it's right to be jumping to conclusions if we don't even know what the nationwide NRC exercise will look like."", ""You need to specify your country of origin for getting citizenship under CAB, isn't it ?""]",Politics

e69fln,Possible scam on the huge Youtube tech channel PhoneRadar. I am the winner. Need advice,2382,"Hello everyone,

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)

My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

Thanks.

Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 

Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 

Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 

Update 4: RIP inbox.

Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!

Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today.

But after a bit of reading some inferences had to be drawn.\n\n1. The current testing method i.e, RT-PCR can be done only on symptomatic persons with a significant viral load. Using this method on asymptomatic persons may not only render the test wasteful but also may not yield accurate results.\n2. Citing South Koreas testing rate and saying we should be achieving those rates is a misnomer for 2 reasons. A.) We simply do not have required number of testing kits and B.) It's virtually impossible for us to even get anywhere close to S. Koreas testing rate given the confounding factors of size, variance and most importantly incapacities in the healthcare system.\n2. I think ICMR has devised a strategy of concentrating their efforts on hotspots and then try and contain infections in those regions. Which to be fair seems logical and scientific given the fact that almost all infections across the world be it China, Italy or even USA are region specific.\n3.

8k08vv,"I made 13 illegal toll booth vanish overnight, milking 3-4 lakhs everyday, using RTI",2324,"For decades traveling from native village to the railway station I had been paying toll to cross a bridge, that only kelp on increasing year after year. There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. 

So I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.

Fun Fact: 

* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.
* 3. I happen to meet someone who bragged about his uncle being the toll collector for toll station I had filed RTI, while this whole thing was going on.

ar504q,People don't understand the differences between the army and the paramilitary. BUT THEY MUST.,2257,"So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn't very surprising for me as I've been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. 

Following five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):

    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) 
    Border Security Force (BSF) 
    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 
    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) 
    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)

CRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or ""war-like"" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. 

The CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).

CAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay & perks. 

>A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience

>“We’re like a body,” he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. “Just because the heart is more important, you can’t ignore the knee.”

CAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan's viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. 

>Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to ""other"" unspecified medical reasons.

They even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.

> Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include ""lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife"".

TL;DR:

We comfortably deify the army but we don't understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. 

But more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.

b0gd70,Does my period really makes me impure?,2261,"I despise my periods not because they hurt me, but because of the amount of crappy rules I'm made to follow. It's unbelievable that people find it so hard to move on with time. If anyone of you have seen the movie padman, you know what I'm talking about. 

I am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.

It's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. 

Does my period really make me so impure?

Edit: Thank you for all the love and support! I honestly didn't know this was that big of a problem until you people pointed it out. Especially the not eating thing. I didn't know it can have long term effects. The problem with that is that if I force my mother to let me eat then she will make me stay in that hell disgusting room for whole 2 days.

ciddbn,I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,2220,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

I loved Bangalore, loved Kannada people but hated engineering and the college. I grew up in Jodhpur Park - right next to Jadavpur University. I even had ice cream when the chemical engineering department used to make them as an experiment? I think it was the chem engg dept but I could be wrong. You were probably in first year when I was in PG1.   \n\nI did not face any of the adversities that you do - not even half of them. As I read your post, I realized how privileged a life I have had.    \n\nNone the less, dropped out of engineering - joined JU Arts. As much as people hate on JU arts - they are the most liberal people I have seen. There was a senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to JU arts and encourage them. Mind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now!   \n \nAnyways, JU arts turned it around for me. I did decently there, went onto get 2 masters and then finally into a PhD which I am hoping to graduate next year. I am 31 now and ironically I code for statistical analysis now. I had dropped out of CSE engineering and the only difference is I like what I do now.   \n\nThe moment I read JU, I hoped JU would be the turning point for you - just as it was for me. But we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take.   \n JU is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as a student is nothing but family.     \n\nDon't let people tell you what to do and how to do it. I have had really stupid people both in JU and mostly outside tell me that I would amount to nothing  - because I dropped out and because of my age. Bro, I started my PhD at 27 - two students I met in my cohort 1. An American African woman aged 41 2. A White gentleman aged 55 who had just retired from American Army. These two were older that most of the cohort which was by average 35 years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the PhD cohort. PhD cohort's have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go, especially the econometrics paper. While the lady was not that good at maths, she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper. They outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects. I ended up being really good friends with both of them. In fact they are the closest friends I have on campus. So no, age is honestly a number and nothing else - fight the good fight!  \n\n\nIf you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out - please reach out to me! This was actually my last summer break here in the country and I will be in Philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything I can help you with - please reach out! I am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country.   \n\nAnd again - fight the good fight, I am sure you will do great.   \nI leave you with a song that I used to listen to when I got depressed in JU about my career trajectory. The song was an anthem for us dropouts - Pulak da wrote the song. Pulak da was from Philosophy department and died in a road accident.

The axis of rotation of earth is tilted by 23.5 degrees with respect to a perpendicular to this plane(or one can say the angle between the equatorial plane of earth and the elliptical plane through which it revolves around sun) . Imagine a snapshot where earth is (tilted towards right) on far left of sun. Due to the tilt, the northern hemisphere is closer towards the sun than the souther hemisphere leading to a summer in the northern and winter in the southern. This position of far left is called as the summer solstice (wrt northern hemisphere). Yes , the position on the far right is called as winter solstice. As earth revolves around sun there comes another position which is in between the two solstices, called as an equinox where a person standing at the equator will have the sun exactly above his/her head in the noon. This day is also called as a no shadow day for the equator. I,e, if a vertical body (with almost no width) is kept in the noon , you won't be able to see its shadow(theoretically). Such a no shadow day occurs only twice in a year for a location in between 23.5 deg North and 23.5 deg South latitudes. There are no no shadow days   beyond those latitudes. The day of no shadow for the equator is termed as an equinox. \n\nPS: The equator does not pass through India , therefore today is not a no shadow day for us.

The main camps were deeper in POK around (12-20km) Those pigs who escaped the first onslaught were then painstakingly tracked through drones/comms to well disguised newly erected made shift launching pads. IA decided to share their movements over the last days with PMO. With the porkis playing cry baby and playa hating on the international forum, IA/PMO decided that this message should be made loud and clear.\n\nA platoon of Paras went in silent, HAHO from well inside our territory. Their target was 3 launching pads deeper into POK, around 2-3km in. These were the larger groups, around 12 pigs at each site. Paras wasted them quietly, they didn't know what hit em, they wasted the sentries with silenced sniper shots and most were slaughtered in their sleep.. Ghataks from Dogra and Bihar opened up fire on the posts near 3 launching pads closer to the LOC (around 600m-1.2km in), the adjoining posts were destroyed rapidly :shoot:, this is where around 6-12 PA manning the posts were killed, Porkis only claim 2 PA killed, bet its 2 bodies they could recover, the rest would have been mulch.\nAfter turning the posts to rubble, Ghataks crossed over and destroyed the 3 launching pads where they killed smaller fidayeen squads of around 6 terrorists each. Ghataks went in loud, watching them close in with heavy fire at the 3rd launching pad, it appears one of the pigs blew himself up taking half his squad with him. :rofl:The death toll inflicted by the Ghataks is not clear because they used volleys from grenade launchers, RPO flame thrower, carl gustaf. A Ghatak got close enough to stab 2 bunched pigs with his bare hands.\n\nWhile the op was coming to a close, it appears a couple of truck loads of SSG BATs & Rangers were sent in for reinforcements but when they arrived and saw the volume of fire coming from the Ghataks, they got back in their trucks and ran. Ghataks then covered the Para's egress back.\n\nFinal, estimate of toll is between 60-70 killed including at least 6-12 PA.\n\nI am glad they decided to make it public. Paltan ki ijjat especially for Bihar and Dogra restored, they will however keep a low profile because there was nothing surgical about their role. Their role was much more akin to a hammer coming down hard. My family member says that the sheer speed and brute force of Ghataks in their role was some of the most beautiful IR drone footage caught in his recent memory.

Reason for doing for overt act maybe because India feels confident that the action can be defended diplomatically with other countries (obviously excluding Pakistan) and that the other countries (USA, Russia, EU etc) might condemn it but not impose any penalties.\n\nSimilar action is frequently taken by Israel as a reaction to attacks on its territory.', 'this made it to r/all in 2 hrs', 'I think the dice has been rolled.

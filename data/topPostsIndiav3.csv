#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

65,g8bbxl,Legal Notice to BECIL for it's tender to procure employee tracking smartwatches and a Covid-19 mass surveillance system,7,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pdbvxe09p4v41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a6d60f331042484a2c6b7038314ade4e9d3999f

### Tl;dr

IFF has sent a [legal notice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GbWcIYqP7fI6kzatt44TiQOJiuHbqrqx/view?usp=sharing) to a government entity BECIL that intends to procure two items (amongst a larger procurement of various other medical safety devices), i.e.  *“Personnel Tracking GPS Solution”* and the *“Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool”.* We have called on BECIL to modify it's tender to account for the grave breaches to the privacy, dignity and autonomy of health care professionals and members of the public that will be caused by these technologies being used and implemented by the Government.

### Background

We strongly support medical professionals who are the first responders to Covid-19. Protecting public health is a priority for all of us over at IFF. However, this cannot and should not be approached by breaches to privacy, dignity and autonomy of individuals, especially — medical professionals —  in the absence of any clear basis in law.

This is why we have sent a legal notice to the Broadcasts Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL is a PSU under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting). Our notice dated April 26, 2020 is limited to items in the tendering process specifically the *“Personnel Tracking GPS Solution”* and the *“Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool”.* The procurement commenced for these technology tools while ostensibly intended to address health risks of Covid-19 cause certain injury to the constitutional rights of privacy, dignity and security rights of health care workers and those at risk of being infected by this virus.

### ""Personnel Tracking GPS Solution"" : Smartwatches or Digital Handcuffs?

The first item sought to be procured is the “*Personnel Tracking GPS Solution*” for the ostensible health and safety of medical professionals and, “*rescue teams*”. The data collected through the, “*cloud based software application*” will be stored in a “*data centre… in India*”. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2ba0i8iap4v41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a63103795b3e176e76a16e854dcd80f5e1f9110

Specifically, there are three illegal features of this system as per the, “*Solution Objective*”, that will be implemented through a “*wrist watch/I-card/App*”.

* **Deployment through physical wearable devices:** There are repeated references to the use of this system through a, “*wrist watch/I-card/App*” which presumes that the deployment may be implemented through a personal wearable that is made compulsory.
* **Restrictive, invasive monitoring of healthcare workers through features such as geo-fencing and live movement tracking:** The product functionality of this personnel tracking system is extensive with the ability for administrators to create, “*geofencing of zones*” and “*track workers of their location during working hours*”.
* **Use of facial recognition technologies intended to prevent, “impersonation control”:** The “*wrist watch/I-card/App*” should have the ability to “*manually take photograph of the person who is wearing the wrist watch/ I-Card/ App*”, and “*store all employees reference pictures which will be used regularly by a designated set of supervisory staff to compare with the photos shot by the workers during working hours*”. Further functionality is indicated for, “*AI Based face detection of Employee*”.

***“Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool” : A digital leash on every Indian?***

As per the Addendum No. 1 dated April 17, 2020 an additional item has been added for procurement under the title of a “Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool”. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/og1wugpbp4v41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4236b7d25023415ed2dc23cf09865ed147fc3c

This tool, is incredibly invasive as per the following functionality listed below:

* **Leaps from healthcare surveillance to national security:** The intended objective of the tool as listed in Item No. 1 of the specifications is to conduct, “*Intelligence investigation platform & tactical tool to detect, prevent and investigate threats to national security”.*
* **Integration of multiple databases and personal data points:** The “*Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool*” is required to pull/collect information from multiple existing government databases and personal data points such as “*telecom data and internet data*”.
* **Mass surveillance by design:** The functionality of the “*Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool*” is mass surveillance by its very design. The desired functionality includes, “*to identify suspect Locations, Associations & Behaviour.*” This includes, “*Easily Geo- Fence an area of interest (eg Meeting place, airport, mosque, railway station, bus stand etc) and identify all the people present at the location at the time of event*” and, *Should be able to Identify a suspects behaviour, see what he or she does on specific days of the week, where does he or she order food from, where does the suspect go for regular walks, where does he/she work during the day, where does he/she sleep at night etc.*”. We have also in our notice objected to the absence of secular language (by the mention of, ""mosque"") in a government procurement which may increase a stigma for certain communities. 

### Our legal notice and intention to take further action. 

Today, i.e. April 26, 2020 we sent a [legal notice to BECIL](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GbWcIYqP7fI6kzatt44TiQOJiuHbqrqx/view?usp=sharing) clearly stating that the project offends the fundamental right to privacy, dignity and autonomy. We specifically reasoned how this project lacks any legality. In addition to this notice we intend to follow up this matter rigorously by seeking transparency in each step of this procurement and also if such situation does arise to examine steps to challenge it before an appropriate body. 

We hope this situation does not arise and BECIL acting within the powers reserved under the tendering process modifies and removes the procurement of both the *“Personnel Tracking GPS Solution”* and the *“Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool”.* This also makes just common sense given the availability of funds should be focused towards the immediate needs of healthcare professionals such as PPC (Personal Protection Coverall) Kits which are also a part of the present procurement. 

Incidentally, this is our second legal notice to BECIL with the[ first being on the now recalled Social Media Communication Hub](https://internetfreedom.in/notice-on-the-social-media-communication-hub-saveourprivacy/). Subsequent to our notice the Ld. Mahua Moitra, Member of Parliment, Lok Sabha had filed a[ public interest litigation in the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India leading to it's recall](https://twitter.com/internetfreedom/status/1025265141087129601). We urge BECIL to be mindful of this undertaking to even in the present procurement as it involves common concerns of mass surveillance and impact on the privacy of medical professionals – as well as every Indian.

67,g89umu,I really wana change make my parents proud or show them that I have grown and matured a bit. Wat do I do?,8,"I am 24 year old and am still in my graduation since I have dropped from my college in the 4th year (studying engineering of course) which my parents (especially my mom) think is the worst mistake I hve made and after that it's never been the same. Whenever they are sad or pissed they can only say either of this thing:-
1. Remind me mistake that I have dropped from college which for them like no one else in this world does. 
2. Comparinge to my brother or to my cousin brother who are really good in studies and are earning pretty well now. 
3. Reminds me that I don't know the value of money. 

And whenever I listen to all of this thing I just get too irritated and say something back which just hurts them a lot. I know very well that I have made  big mistake and it's gonna take some time to reach those level at which my brother or cousin brother at. 
But it's totally true that I speak too loud and yeah I do get irritated easily when someone just points out my mistake instead of explaining them nicely to me. 
So I really wana change my way of speaking/talking  so that no more fight happens with my family especially my mom. I feel like if I change my way of explaining things  or stop talking so loudly that they don't feel like am. Screaming at that it might happen but u have tried it in the last 2-3 days and it's has just become a habit that I get loud when I get irritated. 
Wat the hell do I do? Even I don't want to feel bad for me anymore. Even I want them to  support me instead of just reminding me my past mistake and even I really wana show them that I hve grown / matured a bit. I really feel like it will only happen when I start earning good or get a job.

Reacting irritably will only create a larger vicious cycle.\n\nEvery single day you think you have made a mistake, the anger and irritability increases. It's good that you realise you have a habit of getting loud when irritated, you just need to be conscious of it every single time you're getting irritated, stop talking, go into your room, talk to yourself or distract yourself but make sure you go and have a conversation with them once you cool down.

Don't let others opinions and wishes spoil your life. Just try to ignore all the hurtful things they say, learn to control your emotions and try to focus on your goal, it doesn't matter how long it takes , there are no rules saying you need to get a good job by 25.

1. Why do they not question the government they put in office?

""Badon se sawaal karta hai? Iskii himmat dekho toh! Dande padenge toh akal aayegi."" ^A

2. Why do we gag our media when it criticises us and brings foreign attention?

""Padosiyon ke saamne naak kataa dii isney. Aaj se tera ghar se nikalna band!"" ^B

3. Why do we protect criminals as long as they couch their appearance in religiosity?

""Nahi nahi. Woh toh puja paath karne waale aadmi hain. Wo aisa kar hii nahi sakte!"" ^C

4. Why do we blame victims of state violence instead of holding the powerful to account?

""Maarenge nahi toh kya karenge? Tuune hii kuchh kiya hoga! Warna kyun maarte tujhe! Babuji ko gussa mat dila!"" ^D

The people who rule us are only a problem because we are. Good politics emerges from a good culture. Bad politics is a result of bad social practices. The first steps towards an equal society must therefore be taken in our own homes. Stand up to bad behaviour everywhere!

He has Leukemia ( diagnosed in 2016) and  **Bronchitis** and he's been so paranoid about the whole coronavirus precautions, I think something has gone wrong with him I think he needs professional help.

&#x200B;

* He wears a mask almost all the time Inside the house
* Our house is on the 4th floor and opens from both sides. IDK how but he thinks the air will bring in particles of coronavirus so we've been living with closed doors and very poor ventilation for the past 1 month.
* We also own the roof rights but since he is afraid of the Air, he doesn't allow anyone to go there and for breathing fresh air. he rarely stands at the balcony.
* He doesn't want anybody to use AC in the house because of...( pretty obv by now)
* Nobody comes in or goes out of the house. The last time we went for a grocery run was like a month ago. We've been fueled by just that. 2 times daal roti a day, almost every day. Fruits sometimes. He thinks anyone can bring the virus inside the house. Ration will probably run out in a week I have no idea what we're gonna do. The last time I ate a green vegetable was also a month ago. He Doesn't allow us to buy vegetables either from the street hawkers or online marts.
* Just when the lockdown started, our water purifier broke down ( eff you Kent ) . for the first few days, we were drinking tap water by boiling it and then cooling it rapidly. Then he got paranoid that it's affecting his kidney so we somehow managed to bring in a few crates of bisleri 1l bottle. They'll run out soon.
* Someone told him not to put the phone on the ear while talking so now we all talk on speakers or earphones.
* He has had a total of 15 or 16 hours of sleep in the last 7 days. Takes a sleeping pill but it only affects him for 2 hours. ( its a 5mg). Too scared to take any more than that. Hasn't had any fresh air for the past month.
* Has constant headaches and migraines.

Long story short,  he is quite bad and literally on the border. He cries a lot these days and it breaks my heart to see him like this.

So here's the thing. He just wants to go back to the family house in UP ( Moradabad ). He's been having a guilt trip of not leaving the city in time and I don't know how to get us(family of 4) there. Is there a way I can leave border into UP without being stopped. \[ ***he also thinks that as soon as we try to go for the border, they will lock us up in quarantine wards \]***.

&#x200B;

I'm not looking for medical help. Trust me, I've tried, Counselors, Psychiatrists , NIHMANS Helpline. All of it. Nothing worked and I doubt anything will. It's just the last hope. To go back to Moradabad for some reason. If this goes on, He'll either Die by the end or either I'll commit suicide because you can't possibly begin to think how difficult it is here. I just need a way to cross the border somehow without being denied or being put into quarantine.

189,g7ctdc,"[Drama] Richa Chadha shared an old tweet screenshot of Rishi Bagree (BJP IT cell worker) accepting that he spreads propaganda for BJP daily, which he claimed was a fake tweet and threatened her with a legal defamation case. Later it was found that the fake tweet is indeed real and was tweeted by him",404,"Going to be a long story but worth the drama (i guess) if you are bored. 

TLDR: Richa Chadha shared an old tweet picture of a BJP IT cell worker which says that his daily work is spreading propaganda on twitter. The IT cell employee claims it as a fake tweet and threatens to file a defamation case. But, after a few hours, Twitter users prove that the tweet was indeed real. Instead of accepting his mistake, he is now trying to mud-sling those people by creating morphed tweets.

So, Richa Chadha and few others [shared](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWW4A-aUYAE5iuF.jpg) a picture of Rishi Bagree's tweet on July 10th 2016. The tweet says 

""Dear @AmitShah 
We spend almost 5-6 hrs/daily defending BJP
Ignoring our Family
Ignoring our health

& now a BJP min is branding us as TROLL""

A little background regarding the tweet, on July 8th 2016, Maneka Gandhi (then BJP minister) [approached IT Ministry to deal with abusive trolls](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/maneka-gandhi-social-media-bullies-beware-maneka-gandhi-war-on-trolls-328121-2016-07-08). It is [said](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cm-0gNCXYAEG5Tx.jpg) that she has given a list of abusive twitter (and FB) users to twitter India (and FB India) and asked them to block such users. There were some reports that the list included some of the BJP IT cell members. And that caused outrage among the BJP IT cell members, leading to tweets such [like this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnFtYhGWEAAO0n1.jpg) from rishi (notice the date, just two days after Maneka's attack on abusive users).

After 4 years, some people found that tweet to be funny and shared it on twitter, Richa Chadha did the same. Then came the moron Bagree with [absurd reasons](https://twitter.com/rishibagree/status/1253611143282622465) claiming the tweet she shared is fake and [threatened](https://twitter.com/rishibagree/status/1253624497644552192) her for legal action if she didn't apologize to him. She then [apologized](https://twitter.com/RichaChadha/status/1253623633756520449) and deleted the shared tweet. Without knowing the truth, as usual, bhakts jumped the bandwagon of bullying her and even asked the moron rishi to ""not leave her"" wtf?

Then few twitter users proved that the tweet is not fake and the moron tweeted that for real [Proof 1](https://twitter.com/andh_bhakth_/status/1253628890200698880) [Proof 2](https://twitter.com/Joydas/status/1253678202926424064) [Proof 3](https://twitter.com/zoo_bear/status/1253702288419336198) [Proof 4](https://twitter.com/CatWomaniya/status/1253724299464265733).

Then the fellow bhakts came to bagree's help. [Here's](https://twitter.com/choga_don/status/1253704087046107136) one moron trying his hand at Microsoft paint, trying to mud-sling Richa and bagree retweeted it (deleted later, can't find the link rn).

Instead of the current coercive lockdown, these scientists had advised “community and civil-society led self-quarantine and self-monitoring,” through their research in February 2020. \n\n>\tThe research had warned of a large outbreak of the Coronavirus in India and indicated that the measures taken by the government until then were not enough. The scientists recommended ramping up testing and quarantining facilities, putting in place nationwide monitoring mechanisms and arranging enough protective resources for health-care workers. \n\n>\tAmong the scientists who conducted this research were several later appointed to the government’s task force on Covid-19. \n\n>\tFor more than a month, the research and advice of these scientists went unheeded.

203,g7tzgx,CBSE school of Kolkata laid off a teacher friend of mine who was serving her notice period making an excuse of saving resources owing to COVID lockdown. What should we do?,6,"I'm not going to name my friend for the sake of privacy so let's call her Arushi. Arushi was teaching at The Newtown School, Kolkata for the past one year, and she had given her resignation in the end of the month of February, and by contract she was meant to serve a notice period of 2 months that was to end on 29th of April. The school closed off temporarily due to the coronavirus lockdown eventually, as every other school did. On the 17th of April, she sent a mail to the school HR asking for instructions on how to go about the exit procedure. To which, the HR replied that the school no longer requires her services after the 15th of April (which was a date **before** she even sent her query letter) and that her notice period is being waived off. This was done without **any** prior notice at all and even though she was doing her duties completely sincerely.

Arushi, then, mailed to the principal and the school's chairman saying that she was serving her duties as she had been asked and also requesting to not end her term during this time of a global pandemic where she will be severely affected by a such a sudden stop in payment. To which the school's HR replied in complete negligence and only highlighted that how contractually, the school has complete rights to waive off the notice period of an employee and they're doing it to save resources. This is from a school that forces teachers to sales pitch parents during PTMs to buy iPads from the school so that it ""aids their children in education"" and also pays incentives to the teachers for every new student admission referrals they could make. (this is just to mention some of the evidences that the so called school is just a huge business playground and would actually have no problem continuing to pay her). This completely done on the grounds that she was a junior employee who did not cut any corners and seemed too credulous to be easily laid out of the organization. They are't doing the same to any other employee(s), in question.

Arushi is thoroughly broken mentally because she had been a dedicated employee of the institution for her entire term and had always stepped out of her obligations so as to help her colleagues and the institution in every way, and the school paid her commitment back in the means of waiving her off without any prior notice, let alone the fact that the term end date (15th Apr) was one that was days BEFORE the date of the letter received (18th Apr). The school also chose to do this in the time of such a global crisis where the government has continually requested institutions and organizations to not lay off employees for the sake of the employees' families. We really don't know what to do or who to talk to about this and we need help. What can possibly be done about this? What should we do? Whom should we try to reach or talk to? Please comment any suggestion that you may have.

It's not like she was working and got laid off. She was already about to leave in 2 weeks.\n\nThe best course of action would be to move on with whatever plans the teacher originally had. This doesn't sound any where closer to devastating. There are people who are actually losing jobs because of corona."", 'If she’s serving her notice period what was she going to do next?', ""I am sorry to sound insensitive but Arushi resigned right and normally she would be serving her notice period. These are uncertain times, so legally since Arushi resigned and her employer accepted her resignation, they can waive the notice period also.\n\nSince Arushi choose to resign, she has no obligation or requirement to stick around to help her colleagues if the employer doesn't want her. Tell Arushi to be more professional as job is a two way relationship. As far as her worries regarding loosing her pay, She should claim her pay till April 15th or the last day her employer made her work, If she is worried about now losing her earnings, then sorry but it was bad timing and unless she requested that her employer rescind her resignation then they are under no obligation.\n\n\nTD;LR: Arushi should not be emotional about a job she is voluntarily resigning from. She followed her contract to give her notice period but an employer can shorten the notice period if they find her replacement or don't need the position.

246,g7awra,My experience attending a protest for the first time as a 17 y/o:,69,"This was written by me a day after the protest, so the timeline will be referred to that way.

Yesterday, for the first time ever, I took part in a protest. A protest which would open my eyes and show me our country like I had never seen before. Despite having a general fear of being in a large crowd and being surrounded by people, I, for the first time ever, felt safe being in the middle of a literal ocean of people. I felt powerful; not in the sense that I alone had the power to influence, but in the sense that my presence contributed to OUR power to influence. Walking into the protest, I expected a lot of pushing and punching but to my surprise, I was not touched a single time. I had a better experience being in a crowd at a protest than I did being in a crowd at the Tirupati darshan. Despite the sheer volume of people present (over 1 lakh) the crowd was the most organized I had ever seen. Then I realised that there was only one thing that separated this crowd from any other crowd: lack of a selfish motive. Every person present did not come for their own personal gain, but for the gain of the country. Be it a crowd at a darshan or a crowd at a bazaar, everyone is there for their own personal benefit. Even at the school assembly, everyone seeks that one extra minute to complete their homework, one extra minute to form their lines, one extra minute to talk to their friends, all for personal gain; which makes the crowd at the assembly seem un-organized. But at this protest, the people represented the common voice on the streets, not themselves. No one expected to have gained anything at the end of the night. Which is what makes a protest so special. 

On the sight of me, my sister and my mom, a few protesters gave us a word of thanks for attending. They were happy to see Hindus taking part too. That made realise that despite this being a Muslim majority protest, it was not about the Muslims. It was not about fighting the government for being excluded. It was not about religion at all. It was, rather, about the absence of religion. About treating everyone as if religion didn't exist. It was not about fighting the government to be included in the list, it was about removing the list altogether. We were fighting for the up-keeing of the Constitution. A Constitution the ruling party does not seem to respect. Throughout our childhood in India, we were taught to look at religion and treat religions with respect. The problem didn't start when we were told to respect other religions, but when we were told to look at religion in the first place. Today when we read a name, the first thing we see is a religion. Lakshmi means Hindu, Ali means Muslim, John means Christian. I myself am guilty of this too but today, the protest showed me that despite religion being deep-rooted in our culture, we can learn to look past it.

A fact: public lunching has more than doubled since 2014, that is, since the BJP came to power. The victims of most of these lynchings were innocent Muslims. These murders have been left unresolved after the government refused to do anything about it. Mob lynchers have even credited Modi as their reason for feeling ""empowered"". Any voice of dissent against the government would be silenced by these lynchers. Today, these voices cannot be silenced. They cannot be killed. It's far too late for that. Finally, the government has received it's most worthy opposition: it's own people. A government which does not respect it's criticism is no government at all. The government is still trying to silence dissent in it's controlled states. UP, Karnataka and Delhi are facing the brunt of this; signs of fear in the ruling party. But every act to silence only raises more voices. And the unity of these voices creates waves; waves which make a difference.

That day I learnt the true meaning of unity in diversity. I learnt what India stands for. I learnt how powerful a protest really is. I learnt the power of unity. And no, Unity is not a 3000 crore statue. As we marched, we saw and heard slogans and chants, some abusing the government and some stating the objective, but there was one chant which stuck with me and kept me thinking about the state of our country: Hindu Muslim Sikh Isai, bhai bhai bhai bhai.

I also came to know later that there were some people in the march who didn\'t belong to the campus.\n\nThat was the first protest march that I participated in and it didn\'t leave a good impression on me, sadly.

So, our director had decided to allow protests, provided that the administartion was informed earlier and only members of the campus participated in the protests, and that the protests were done peacefully.\n\nThis made me happy that despite all that happened in the protest earlier, he didn\'t prohibit protests like in IIT-B.

247,g7uvy6,[AskIndia] How to deal with corona mismanagement in India?,0,"Hello Randians,

Once corona patients are admitted to hospitals, no communication is received till the patient dies or recovers.

If the patient dies, he may not even get reason as covid 19 in his death certificate since state government are trying to suppress deaths. But whole of his family is forcefully taken into quarantine centre. Their house is locked and left unguarded. Many robberies are taking place due to this.

If relatives happen to become corona positive, they will be admitted to hospitals and same process as above will repeat.

Government does not have a clear plan on what to do with corona dead bodies. If they hand over it to relative, they are unable to carry the patients to their home or near by funeral centres due to corona stigmas.

If there is no nearby funeral centre, even hospital would not want to take risk of taking care of cremation. Hospital also would not want to use those dead bodies for lab.

If the family recovers from corona, they are not allowed back to the village/society, even though, they are showing certificate of recovery from the hospital. They are forced to go in hiding.

Now, even in lock down period, cases doubling up every 9 days, India will soon have few lakhs cases.

The mismanagement will cost more life than the corona itself.

258,g7pi5w,Career Help,3,"I know these kind of posts are dime a dozen on here but I still wanted to get some fresh perspective on a dilemma I've been battling with for the past 3 years or so.

So I graduated in 2017 doing my BSc in CS, Phy, and Math from a tier two city. I got a job offer from a mass recruiter but I declined it due to not matching my personal ambitions and generally because I wasn't too enthused about my job prospects with them.

I was first very much into doing my MS in a college with good options and in a field that I felt was challenging and interesting to me. But before I could really do a deep dive and narrowed down the fields, I got to know that it's a high risk taking a loan for myself when my family is reeling in them worth 50+lakhs due to a new house construction.

I know I could have gotten a loan for myself kissing my family and the problems goodbye but somehow it didn't agree with me, so in short I decided to not pursue my MS degree.

I took a part-time job working from home with shit pay but I still put up with it and focused on the few positives, it being that I was able to start my own savings and pay for my own expenses. I left the part-time job last month because my payments got fucked by the guy I was working under (he used it on himself) and decided to become self-employed working in a similar field but with pay which is not fixed and depends on the availability of work and how many hours I put into it.

The WFH job which I'm currently doing is in such a field that I'm not particularly interested in nor have hopes of it sustaining future market fluctuations. But due to a lack of options, it seems like a 'something's-better-than-nothing' situation for me.

 So this leads to present day, writing this post and trying to figure out how the fuck am I supposed to move ahead. For reference, I'm only 24 and I know I have a life ahead of me, but it seems like all my doors are closing one by one if I don't take action for the future I want for myself, one with financial security enough to puruse my own hobbies and interests freely. Because I know in reality it's not that simple to get the best of both worlds.

273,g76o5f,The real loser in India's errupting Islamaphobia: Caste politics.,85,"TLDR: My (unqualified) opinion is that dalit political movement has seen the most erosion in the anti-muslim appraoch the government has championed.

Note: This post is for discussion. If you have nothing but belligerent responses that add nothing to the conversation I will report you. If you only have worn out, down over a thousand times arguments of being caste blind, having merit and anti reservation nonsense, I will be ignoring you. 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, lets talk.

The anti muslim sentiment grows stronger even in lockdown, with the hindu right finding more ways to demonize muslims everyday. I didnt think it could be possible, but every day it seems they have a new angle of attack. 

And such it has been since day 1 i.e. the day the 2014 elections results came out when the muslim techie was murdered by a hindu mob and that mosque attack happened, I'm forgetting where. The very day of the results. Modi hadnt even taken up PMship that day. 

So to begin, Anti-Muslim rhetoric creates a unified Hindu identity. This is something that BJP has long worked for and was one of the goals of VHP, HM and RSS since their inception - create a Hindu identity that trumps caste indentity so that the caste status quo is maintained while killing any caste discourse. 

Now, I'm muslim. And I have no intention of blaming Dalits for the victory of BJP. Dalits, much like Muslims, have been promised much by politicians purporting to be their champions but delivery has been less than spectacular. Lalu's first term & Maywati's first full term withstanding, no government has been able to delivery upon their promises to their dalit and obc voter very much. So yes, I do not blame these communities for voting outside their 'champions', for 'fracturing' the community vote. 

But the fact remains that Modi's government has done spectacular work for the backward communities (barring muslims). We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called ""Congress + Cow"" it has been jokingly called ""Prakash Karat + Cow"". Such is the success of Modi's socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.

But coming to the matter at hand, OBC representation in Parliament has been dropping and sarvana i.e. upper caste repesentation is increasing. Now, Dalits have reserved seats so while their count can not decrease, but this seat reservation is working against them. I'm going to copy paste directly from an article here to explain this

[Not a single constituency in India has more than 50 per cent Dalit population, which means it’s always the non-Dalits who decide the fate of Dalit candidates in reserved constituencies. A vocal or assertive Dalit leader has the least chance of winning from such seats. To be re-elected, a Dalit MP must be careful not to antagonise the non-Dalits, and one way of ensuring this is by remaining silent in Parliament.](https://theprint.in/opinion/17th-lok-sabha-looks-set-to-confirm-ambedkars-fears-no-vocal-dalits-in-parliament/232383/)

Note that Balasaheb knew this would happen. Which is why he proposed that non dalits not be given a vote on reserved seats. I am very much with him on this.

So who is the loser here? Mayawati has lost her base. There can be no doubt about it. The BSP+SP combine failed because SP votes were transfered to BSP but the BSP vote was not. Why? Because Dalits find BJP a more attractive proposition than BSP.  Who else? Lalu and Mulayam have lost a significant base altho this could be attributed to multiple reasons. It is also less significant because OBC leaders are many. Dalit leaders are few. 

While Chandrashekar 'Raavan' Azad has made a great big splash, he is being kept under hold by the government almost since day 1. He has the appeal to be a mass leader and present a large potential threat to the status quo. But he has been muzzled and jailed as often as was possible. 

Ultimately even the news cycles focus on muslim, and the caste conflicts happeneing everyday take a backseat, all the while forgetting that 85% of Indian Muslims are lower caste muslims. Here too, the muslim identity has trumped the caste identity and they are doubly the losers here considering that most muslim victim to Islamaphobic attack tend to be the under privileged and of backward caste.

This is all by design, mind you. The idea here is the same I mentioned earlier. Maintain caste status quo and the cost of caste identity. And its working.

Note that Modi himself never speaks about caste. Despite being an OBC he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences. So his being OBC does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castes.

We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called ""Congress + Cow"" it has been jokingly called ""Prakash Karat + Cow"". Such is the success of Modi\'s socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.\n\nWhat exactly are these policies?', ""Real problem is fake news. Most people aren't smart enough to check facts by themselves."", 'I think for a long time in this country, there was a belief that the 15% Muslims have a veto on who rules India in BJP circles. I think there is a quote by Balbir Punj, former BJP MP saying the same. \n\nThe thing is that although as you say 85% of Indian Muslims are backward classes, the whole community itself was almost a single monolith when it came to voting preferences. \n\nComing to some specific parties, say Mulayam Singh. As the family becomes powerful, it looses focus and becomes a Yadav party and all other OBCs leave. Same for Mayawati. As she becomes all powerful, Jatavs become powerful. All others leave. \n\nBJP, has in fact given tickets to the non Yadav OBCs and non Jatav Dalits in a significant number. What BJP has done at the same time is create the most loyal caste base India has seen: Upper caste Hindus. They will vote BJP because they are scared of everyone else. \n\nThe opposition is not without blame for this. When you constantly 24/7 call BJP a Hindu party screaming at the top of your lungs, you are literally begging the Hindus to vote BJP.\n\nConclusion: I don’t think the caste politics is dying. It’s just that it’s been played in a different way which seems more efficient. \n\nP.S.  this is just a discussion. Do not take anything too seriously', 'I don\'t agree with the ""government uplifting backward classes and hence getting the votes"" part. Most of the policies, as already mentioned by others, predate this government. Furthermore, most of them are either pure disaster(DeMo), mismanaged policies with potential(GST), or did very little compared to how hyped up they were(swaccha bharat, ujjawala). MNREGA, beti bachao beti padao and the likes existed even in UPA era, and were better funded than now.\n\nPoverty literally increased under modi, so did unemployment, and income inequality. I should remind you that UPA under Manmohan uplifted record number of people after poverty in a decade, a record only second to china, farmers too, which constitute most of the backward people in India did far better under Manmohan. \n\nWhat\'s getting them vote is organised hatred they spread online. Indian people are gullible, and BJP were quick to capitalise on that. People don\'t question the policies because they don\'t see the government as the problem, the media and the IT cell have given people other enemies to blame in trying times- Muslims, Congress and Pakistan. \n\nI should add, if you think upper castes think any better of the backward ones now, you\'re wrong. Nobody\'s enlightened, they just have a bigger enemy for now.  If hypothetically, muslims were removed, the caste system will reach it\'s former glory in no time.', 'Pleasantly surprised to see a post like this identifying that a majority of Muslims are indeed erstwhile so called lower caste pedigree. \n\nGoes to strengthen my view that there aren’t really religions in India but castes, castes and castes. \n\nThat out of the way, the lower castes are - by design - kept under educated and under represented that very few realise they’re being used. Example: https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/books/book-review-i-could-not-be-hindu-the-story-of-a-dalit-in-the-rss-by-bhanwar-meghwanshi/cid/1765671\n\nIn Karnataka, for example, many towns have a colony called a “A K colony”. The A K denotes a caste and as opposed to an “agrahaara” which are usually a Brahmin stronghold, the AK colonies are typically a stronghold of a particular low caste often reflecting the gross neglect over time as well. \n\nThese places - and others like it - have always had high unemployment. All of this is a complete package you know. It’s extremely hard to get out of. Anyway, in these places the testosterone fuelled unemployed youth are usually up to no good. Given no support system and discrimination outside and all. Back then they were used by the powerful as henchmen or for other dirty work. Now they’re still used by the powerful but the new powerful are all consolidating under the Hindutva label. \n\nThe caste system is so uniquely ubiquitous in everyday life that the privileged bubble inhabitants can’t even begin to fathom the “world building” that invoked if it all were presented as a novel.\n\nThere are some unique castes - typically the erstwhile landowner class. Who’ve since graduated to owning large institutions, businesses and so on. You know, grown up, productive stuff. I have so much awe for how they look after their own and the sort of support system they’ve developed for themselves which allows even for the “underperformer” amongst them to achieve something in life that he or she may feel proud of.\n\nThis almost never happens in the case of a lower caste disadvantaged person. The rare ones who do happen to break out of it - if they were lucky enough to get some sort of support in the form of reservations _and_ familial, financial support and have the fortitude to survive the education system without being discriminated against. They still face an uphill struggle wherever they end up working at. More so if it’s a government workplace. \n\nIf they excel and do better than their peers they’re subject to allegations of having cheated and get corruption cases filed against them. And after having to face all of this shit in their career are left with little to no wherewithal to be what they wish they had when they were young - a mentor, godfather or a role model to their own “kind”. Just like in the other powerful castes, ahem, “communities”. \n\nAnd that’s where the current _shaaka_s are capitalising on. Catching them young. Keeping them dumb. Not letting them rise. Making them hate each other and the Muslims who’re no different than they are. Driving away the “missionaries” who come with an education package. \n\nA core feature of a hierarchy is that it is designed to always make anyone who’s not at the very top nor at the very bottom to have someone to feel superior to. And those at the lower ladders are at a double whammy position where they’re not enlightened enough to realise the harm they’re doing unto themselves by being part of some of the heinous crimes you hear of in places like TN.\n\nAnyway, it’s a shit show. I’m envious that a majority of the caste denying elitists here don’t have to see or imagine any of this and live their grand privileged lives envying that one SC guy who drove a BMW. \n\nNo political party every stands for them. KA has had exceptional leaders from such castes for decades and they’re _never_ allowed to rise up. It’s by design. Nobody can break out of it.', ""Your analysis is quite correct , and the reason Islamophobia is growing because many lower caste ar getting educated and thanks to propaganda they are likely to see Islam more of a threat compared to Brahminism.\n\n A small example of how Manusmriti ideology has even engulfed Dalits.\n\nI happened to meet One of my batchmate who used to be a torched bearer of Ambedkarism in our university ( we both are Dalits).\nI was shocked to see idols of gods and the blatant karmkand things in his house which he used to vehemently oppose.\n\nI just asked him that what happened to you in all this year's .\n\nHis reply was ' Ye Buddhism Jai bhim wagerah mein maaza nahi hain , kya milta hai Buddhist banke ,enjoyement apne hindu religion mein hi hain, I got so many things when I started following hindu religion. Jai bhim banenege toh koi bhi festival nahi hain. ,Kya matlab uska.\n\nI just told him that your job, degree is only because several decades back a man fought for it with the establishment ,if not for him you would be  sewering in a gutter and doing what you are supposed to do.\n\nMany backward castes which have become affluent due to capitalism post 1990s are more hindus and more casteist than the Brahmins , like Yadav's , Gujjars, Marathas who are more indulged in caste based atrocities compared to the Brahmins ."", ""I think you make valid points regarding (a) why BJP has gained the reserved seats; and (b) caste politics has been overshadowed by the unifying hatred against the Muslims.\n\nWe all probably agree with u/Android5511 that the reason for (b) is not so much the effective implementation of welfare schemes but the successful deployment of polarising techniques by BJP and its media cohorts. That said I find their optimism that Modi-lahar might wane slightly misplaced for three reasons: (i) there is no indication that these polarising techniques have lost their efficiency; (ii) as the present pandemic has given the Center sweeping powers, regular administrative functions and even botched operations are now going to be touted as Modi's achievements; and (iii) the voting behaviour in state elections can be the opposite in central elections, case in point Jharkhand which they refer to.\n\nAnother shortcoming which I find in the print commentariat as they try to understand why Dalits vote for BJP is the shallowness of their analyses. Best exemplified by Dilip Mondal's article that you linked, they fail to answer why is it that Dalit voters, especially in urban areas, don't rally behind radical Dalit leaders. It would require a much lengthier write-up, but I suspect that it is the lure of savarna ethic and the success of capitalism which they are led into believing, owing to the constant media propaganda and the ineptitude of parliamentary Left in India. Please note that I am not saying the savarna ethic is worth emulating or that capitalism is actually successful, quite the opposite I would say. But such is the hegemonising power that the cultural elite have, a point noted by Gramsci and successive others.\n\nThe savarna ethic is a self-replicating one, a virus. One can see that many OBCs and many Dalits become strident defenders of Brahmanism once they acquire a certain degree of social mobility. Led into thinking that their emancipation is because of the savarna ethic, and not despite of it, many try to abnegate their Dalit identity itself. The same can be said about capitalism; it is the lure of this heady cocktail of Baniya capitalism that fuels India and shapes Dalit politics (outside the safe spaces of universities) today. \n\nIn such a context, it is difficult for a Bahujan combine to have any real political teeth, though not impossible. To begin with, such a possibility requires a theoretical agreement between the political actors.""]",Politics

Herd immunity is the phenomenon by which a disease's spread is negated through immunization and/or antibody immunity of a majority of the population.

I am very frustrated with MagicBricks. This is a throwaway account.

I desperately needed money so I decided the best way would be to sell my shop through MagicBricks.

I bought their super titanium package for 13650 Rs on 18th March Evening. (Before lockdown)

Now, I never received their services. The ad never went live. The photoshoot and other services were never received due to lockdown. I am also not able to visit the shop due to lockdown. Interested buyers also won't be able to visit the shop due to lockdown.  


So I asked for a refund by calling them. They created a support ticket and this is the email I received.

They say the ad was on hold as per my confirmation. Without photoshoot, content writing, how is the ad suppose to go live?  On the other hand, they say they are now going to run the advertisement/services by the end of the day.  
No interested buyer would be able to visit the shop till lockdown. I replied to their ticket.

They are now claiming that I have utilized their services, which I obviously haven't and couldn't! They now have enabled services. Without any good photos on the ad, there will be hardly any interested buyers Plus no interested buyers will be able to visit my shop due to lockdown. 

I am forced to delay my plan to sell the shop for a few months.  

I do not have much money left with me. It would take a few months for the shop to be sold. I am a small failed businessman, the banks & other entities won't lend me personal loans or any other loan without collateral. I feel I don't have any option anymore other than getting a loan on collateral.

Since I need money urgently, I cannot afford to wait for months. I have to cancel my plan to sell the shop and get a loan on collateral.

I got a call from the doctor asking me to come in as my name was chosen randomly to be swabbed. An Anganwadi worker accompained me and they even provided pick up and drop off. The whole process took 30 seconds but the wait was longer because of they were testing from 50 wards today. Doctors waiting in the room in PPE kits swab you in thirty seconds. On a scale of 1 to 10, pain level was at most 6. 


The only cons were, no sanitizers for people waiting. No social distancing maintained (even in the transportation) and no one even asking people to do so. I got looks when I told the guy around me to move away a little bit. Although, everyone was wearing a mask, which is good to see.



According to the officials there, they will ramp up the testing and are looking to test people from every ward in Dibrugarh district over the next few weeks. I wanted to take a video of the procedure but was not allowed. But yeah, it isn't very painful.

314,g7a52v,Half-Indian: How do I reconnect with India ?,20,"Hi fellow redditors,

I'm a 28 young man from [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium), my father is Belgian and my mother is Indian. My mother was born in Puducherry in the '60s from unknown parents, she was adopted at the age of 4 by a Belgian couple. Since she was adopted at an early age, she doesn't remember a lot things about India. As a result, my knowledge of India is very limited.

I'm not sure how I should reconnect with my Indian heritage since I don't really have family there. I bought books about the history of India and Hinduism. I plan to visit India in the future and I will probably start with the south of India. I'm considering learning Hindi or Tamil, I'm not sure which one would make the most sense for me to learn.

I have this crazy idea about going back to India, even though it seems like a bad move financially speaking, I feel like I could at least blend in with the locals, something that is not really possible in Belgium. What do you think about this?

Thanks for your replies.", ,"[""I'll give some brutally honest and maybe unpopular advice. Moving to India would be a terrible move.

You have no connections, no contacts, not even any cultural reference. Even if India and Belgium was reversed in this scenario and India was the better place to live, I wouldn't advice moving for social reasons. The truth is your far more connected to Belgium than you'll never be to India, so you just have to accept that and learn how to connect and make friends with folks there, and ignore your genetic makeup. \n\nHaving said that, if you have a generic interest in India, you're more than welcome to visit."", 'If you plan to reconnect with South you especially Puducherry or Tamil Nadu you should prefer learning Tamil over Hindi because the latter is useless in this part of India.', 'I too am bi-racial and understand the feeling of not belonging in either race.

330,g7dn32,Is this racist?,8,"Hello guys, I'm an ispiring author from Brazil. Love your country and culture.

So, to the matter I would like your opinion. 

Recently I finished my latest project. It's an urban fantasy/thriller where a group of young people discover they have powers of gods and creatures from various ancient mythologies. The major problem I found while writing this, was naming the characters, so for most of them, I named them with something that could reference the god they had the powers of.

For exemple, there's Fiona, who has the powers of a shapeshifting witch. Fiona being a common name for a white witch in Ireland. Also Diana, who has the powers of the goddess Artemis, goddess of the moon. For the one with the powers of Zeus, I named Edison after Thomas Edison who had a great deal of influence in revolutionazing electricity.

But the one I struggled the most to name was the antagonist, who has the powers of Apollo. Until someday I mentioned it to a friend of mine and she told me to name him Ravi, a common Indian name that means ""The Sun"". I loved the idea, and I made him have Indian ancestry. His ethnicity wasn't a big part of his character, just some background for him. Nothing wrong with that, right? Or so I thought. It wasn't until I finished it that I became aware of the problem.

A major part of Ravi's early plot, is his job. It's how he meets some important people, it's how he comes to despise the main character. I had written this part before naming him and giving him the Indian ancestry. He works at a telemarketing company. See the big stereotype now? This was never intended.

So now I come to think of it, is this racist/xenophobic? Should I change his name and ancestry or maybe even try to rewritte the plot with him working a different job? What do you guys think?", ,"['We do telemarketing in large quantities.

There was a clear division between Indian and foreign expats in the company.

May be it had more to do with the need to beat the traffic.\n5. Interior Maharashtra: Was in a plant - had a typical plant culture with an all powerful boss, people calling their bosses ""Saheb"". But, this company a bit better than most other plants I have been to or heard about - it had greater camraderie and openness within the teams even though everyone was scared of the plant head.\n6.

392,g779xw,Recommendations for a decent mid-premium price range laptop?,5,"Hey there.
I was planning to buy a decent mid-premium laptop anything below Rs. 1.3 Lakhs.

I'm not a hardcore gamer, so not looking for a fancy graphic card, but anything that fits casual gaming (mostly CS GO) should be alright.

Other than that, most of my time will be spent on  viewing movies and web-browsing (which any standard laptop can do)

Accordingly I believe the following specifications would be good

Intel i7 10th Gen processor
16 GB RAM
512GB /1TB SSD or 1TB HDD with 128 GB SSD
A decent display (4K would be ideal but not mandatory)
Light-weight and preferably touch screen (2-in-1s)

Are they the only solution to fight against deadly coronavirus?** According to Brian Oliver, a respiratory disease researcher and an Associate Professor at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) the ventilator can decide life and death for severe COVID-19 patients. Like Pneumonia, in COVID-19 lungs are filled with fluid and pus which makes it difficult to breathe. A ventilator becomes the only way to make the respiration process easier by moving oxygen into such parts of the lungs that aren’t badly damaged by the virus.

409,g75drq,IFF Suggests Ways to Ensure Internet Access and Protect Net Neutrality,7,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cjt1cicmiqu41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e226c05d68c73b5d28faccd0aa46ada0cd138105

### Tl;dr

Since remote work, online education, telemedicine, and reliance on e-retail becomes critical for the foreseeable future there is a need for authorities to take specific action. IFF has written to the DoT and TRAI suggesting that these interventions must look toward overcoming the digital divide, appreciating the importance of the internet and mobile services as an essential utility, and protect net neutrality. Towards this IFF recommends concerted stakeholder dialogue, evidence based interventions to support network capacity, efforts to use government funds towards providing free access to internet services to underprivileged/essential cohorts of people, ensuring all areas have access to high speed internet access and expediting the implementation of a net neutrality enforcement framework.

### Background

The lockdown has seen greater reliance of many segments of the populace on information and communications technologies, in particular the internet. People are using the medium for various purposes such as remotely working from home, distance learning, ordering essential items via e-retail, and telemedicine purposes. More generally, people also use it to stay in touch with their friends, family and loved ones, which is crucial to people’s mental health in these trying times.

In various guidances and notifications, telecommunication and internet services have been repeatedly classified by the Ministry of Home Affairs as essential items. In this regard, the importance of internet and telecommunications access has assumed considerable importance during the current public health crisis. It also brings with its own set of policy and regulatory challenges which must be addressed. If unaddressed, we believe there is a risk that the novel coronavirus may exaggerate the digital/technological divide; stress underlying network infrastructure and risk network neutrality.

### Prior Correspondence with the DoT and TRAI

In a letter dated March 18, 2020 IFF previously wrote to the Hon’ble Minister of Communications and copied this to the DoT and TRAI. In it we anticipated that there may be a risk of undue pressure on underlying internet and mobile networks due to shifts and likely increases in network usage. Therefore we suggested authorities:

1. Conduct periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure in consultation with telecom and internet service providers, content providers, startups and consumer facing organisations. Here, we stressed on the importance of preserving principles of net neutrality.
2. Encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies towards not terminating people’s connections, due to an inability to pay their bills.
3. Urged the Central Government to issue an advisory that States and Union Territories should not issue internet suspension or restriction orders under the Telecommunications Suspension Rules, 2017.

### So Why Are We Writing This Time?

This is because there are new threats which are emerging, since the commencement of our over month long national lockdown.

### 1. Threat to Net Neutrality

In a letter dated March 21, 2020 the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) wrote to TRAI requesting for clearance of charges for voice and data for certain websites and telephone numbers. Additionally, an Economic Times [**report** ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/telcos-suggest-free-access-to-critical-sites/articleshow/74784534.cms?from=mdr)suggested concessions to zero rate certain essential websites pertaining to government services, ecommerce and digital payments applications like the BHIM app, without being charged for data during the lockdown period.

To be sure, TRAI’s Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016, which ostensibly prohibits zero rating of data tariffs in India does allow for exemptions. However, we must consider such developments along with the fact that COAI has also written to online video content providers, to reduce their bitrates to alleviate stress on underlying network infrastructure. By referencing measures taken by online content providers in jurisdictions like Europe, we have noticed that most participants in the Indian market have complied and reduced their offerings to SD bitrates.

These measures have been taken by industry and have been taken with little evidence available to the public of the actual stress being placed on India’s underlying networks, owing to the national lockdown being excessive. India’s internet infrastructure has traditionally been characterised as underutilised, and therefore even according to existing capacities should be able to handle a 20 percent surge in network traffic. This fact may be contrasted with reports which found that mobile internet use (India’s wireline subscriber base remains very less) only increased by 10 percent in the month of March 2020. Pertinently, in Tier 1 metros the increase was even more modest at 3-5 percent.

Thus, it may be concluded that without appropriate review and response mechanisms, there is a threat to India’s net neutrality regime. As such net neutrality in India remains imperfect owing to the fact that we are yet to finalise a definition of what falls under reasonable traffic management practices, and actual means of monitoring and enforcement. This lacuna in the framework has meant internet access providers in India can avoid compliance net neutrality obligations, under licensing conditions, with relative impunity. We have previously [**written to the government about these concerns in March and May, 2019 respectively**](https://internetfreedom.in/net-neutrality-in-india-needs-to-find-its-bearings/).

### 2. Risk of the Digital and Technological Divide

It is reasonable to conclude that the pandemic is sure to hit those working in informal sectors and marginalised communities at large the hardest.

A recent report on [**The Print**](https://theprint.in/india/education/no-gadgets-no-studies-what-online-classes-mean-for-16-lakh-poor-students-in-delhi-schools/406837/) and an article by Mr [**Osama Manzar (Digital Empowerment Foundation, Founding Director)**](https://www.apc.org/en/blog/def-we-need-free-talk-time-and-internet-during-covid-19) are instructive in this regard. The Print article discusses how the coronavirus is shifting students to distant learning situations reliant on online/IVR based classes/educational setups. This means that in areas like Delhi, students from underprivileged backgrounds are at a distinct disadvantage owing to a lack of digital literacy, no availability of supporting equipment in the household like laptops and smartphones, chargers, and no access to high speed internet connections.

Similarly, Mr Manzar’s article also communicates that aside from internet access, many people from informal/marginalised backgrounds do not even have access to basic mobile connections as well. He illustrates this with the recent exodus from urban to rural areas after the announcement of the national lockdown. In it many people travelled in groups-- to the detriment of social distancing protocols.  This is because the availability of phones with talk time to make calls, was often restricted to one or two persons in large groups. And in such times of hardship, the ability to make a timely phone call to a friend or family member can be a question of life and death.

### IFF’s Recommendations

Keeping the above considerations in mind we urged the Ministry of Communications, DoT and TRAI to collectively consider the following interventions:

1. **Regular Review and Reports on Impact of  COVID-19 on Internet Capacity**: India should have twice a week meetings between DoT, TRAI, TSPs/ISPs, internet exchange points, CDN providers, cloud service providers, content providers, small businesses, video conferencing app developers, consumer groups and so on, to ascertain the actual impact COVID-19 is having on internet capacity and quality of service. The findings from these meetings along with support evidence should be published for the public at large. This will be analogous to the approach adopted by European authorities like BEREC.
2. **Consider Means to Expand Telecom Infrastructure Capacity:** Although India’s internet infrastructure has traditionally been characterised as under utilised, Indian authorities must be alive to the possibility that there may be a need to consider means through which it can ease network maintenance and deployment of internet access services. India must consider steps in this regard. For instance, it may consider discussions with TSPs to maintain an open dialogue on the need to expand network capacity, upgrading network equipment, capacity expansions of base stations in mobile networks, etc. It should also consider the need to free up access to particular airwaves to ensure networks are up and running in an interference free manner.
3. **Expedite Final Recommendations and Implementation of TRAI’s Net Neutrality Consultation:** Considering advances being made by internet access providers which seek exceptions to the net neutrality frameworks, it becomes even more imperative that India expedites its finalisation of its definition for reasonable traffic management practices. At the same time there is a need for more robust monitoring, enforcement and institutions. Therefore, it becomes necessary for authorities to conclude its findings on the latest TRAI [**consultation**](https://main.trai.gov.in/consultation-paper-traffic-management-practices-tmps-and-multi-stakeholder-body-net-neutrality) on traffic management practices and a multistakeholder body for net neutrality.
4. **Consider Means for Free Wi-Fi Hotspots, Access to Laptops/Smartphones and 4G Router Availability:** We have urged DoT and TRAI to consider commencing an initiative which deploys funds available under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF). Along these lines, we also recommend they consider possibilities of working with the Ministry of Home Affairs and state governments to gauge availability of funds under the National Disaster Relief Fund and State Disaster Response Funds. These funds should be used toward facilitating public wi-fi hotspots, 4G routers, internet devices and so on, in particular targeting benefiting students from underprivileged backgrounds, informal workers, healthcare workers, first responders, and people from marginalised communities. 
5. **Urge industry to not disconnect people’s internet/mobile services, and provide free data during lockdown period:** Indian authorities and access service providers should identify vulnerable groups who would benefit from such targeted interventions, which help with the response but also help bridge the digital divide. We would also suggest TRAI and DoT work together with access providers in ensuring that people can have uninterrupted access to their internet and mobile services even if they fall behind on their payments or recharge schedules. Under utilised funds in USOF may be a useful tool in this regard as well.
6. **Urge States and UTs to Maintain Access Full Speed Mobile and Internet Connectivity During Lockdown:** We urged central authorities to consider ways to limit government powers to issue directives which throttle the internet. Therefore, we recommended the issuance of an advisory which urges states to not issue any directions which suspend internet access or impose restrictions on accessing high speed internet.

As the amount required is huge, I request you to kindly contribute towards the treatment and help during this time of need. Each contribution is important!

Please help us raise this amount by clicking on the donate button and sharing this page with your friends and family.

We are grateful for your help and wishes.

Thank you.

Sure, between the two - a choice that will never be given to anyone in practice - the kerala model is better for overall betterment of the society.\n\nBut in practice, the Kerala model evolved thanks to a lot of factors: Social movements against caste and for equality, enlightened kings, international sea trade, little interference by the British, lack of invasions like in North, missionaries with their focus on education, competition by the kings and other religions in education as well as healthcare... All of which led to a strong awareness of rights learned from the Left which even influenced the Congress, a good dose of capitalism when it comes to investment in education and healthcare, the opening of the Gulf and later other countries to skilled and unskilled malayalees who send money back and so on. Land reforms were another.\n\nIt also has its negatives when it comes to the left's inability to be a constructive opposition, too many strikes and hartals, and an earlier strong opposition to capitalism which they have mostly abandoned.\n\nGujarat does not have any of those advantages but what it has is a good number of highly entrepreneurial people (who have over time because very strongly communal), a huge tribal population that has not benefited and which proponents of the Gujarat model actively try to ignore or downplay...\n\nMost states of India are not in a position to adopt either model. But they can pick and choose and try to implement some parts.\n\nGoa where I live now is a different example. Little state, but without the massive social reform movements etc but with the influence of Portuguese, and thanks to tourism from the hippie days, an openness to the world. However, the lack of deliberate social reform movements still has a strong impact, which is easily visible among a minority of the population as strong hostility to other communities, hostility to tourism, to any outsiders and despite the comfort with western attire and skin show, an inability to think of people unlike them as their equals.

Is it a signal that he has served his purpose and now can be done away with..?
Or has he mistakenly questioned his masters (remember how a while ago godi-media was asking questions to BJP which left them fuming) and the masters want to set an example for everyone by mock-atracking him...
Has he asked too much of a price, we do know he got a shiny new office right after elections..?
Is he trying to garner sympathy coz Maharashtra CM has said that people who are giving undue communal angle to Palghar lynching will be taken to task..?

501,g6vels,My mom's college is not paying this month's salary to any staff/worker. Can I do something?,12,"Hi guys,

My mom's college has not paid this month's salary yet, to any of the employee. From teachers, to peons and guards. 

Now it's one thing to not give salary to senior staff for whatever reason but for low salaried workers like peons and guards, they might already be going through hell because of lockdown. Not recieving their salary will be a big punch in their gut. 

Can they do this? Didn't the government instructed organizations to not cut salary or lay off employees? Was it just some recommendation or is there a law and people can take action if someone doesn't follow it? 

I'm not mentioning the name of the college (yet) until I have some direction to think. It's a private one in Indore.

My mom is senior teacher and we're only worried about the low wage workers at the moment. She told me that talking to the college authorities will be a waste of time because they are really toxic and don't entertain these talks.

Please suggest me something.

Edit: One more clarification - Teachers here are still working full-time. My mom has to take lectures, report back with student attendence, and other duties. I forgot to mention it earlier.

I've tried a variation of most of the options here, the best thing that worked out for me is to just use the official documentation for whatever language / tool that you want to learn and see what they recommend an example is if you want to learn vue js then just study their entire documentation and try out all the examples and then try a sample project that you've wanted to do, if you don't know what project you want to implement them search for good project ideas online on medium or GitHub or reddit or wherever, some tech like android have their own offical course by googlers themselves and from what I remember they really were good so it really depends on each of the tech but the official one is the best, there might be some cases where the official documentation sucks in which case you have to start thinking if whether the language/tool/tech you are learning really is a good one because usually most good tech has good documentation and a lot of people contributing to it except in really really rare cases.\n\nOnce you know the language the next thing you would probably want to do is how to write the code in a neater way, I personally would recommend books on writing clean code (Clean Code is a personal favourite of mine) and then read books on design patterns (take this in slowly because I ended up reading them too quickly the first time without even understanding this properly and fucked up my code big time on a project and I'm still paying for the flaws I've made) and watch videos of the conferences that these tech holds, it helps you be updated and see what the top guys of these tech are upto and what they recommend.\n\nAs for competitive programming, it really depends on what your end goal is, I usually get this occasional itch where I don't want to develop something but I just want to program during these times I just log onto a competitive programming site and then just pick a random problem and then try to solve it and end up learning a data structure or algorithm technique, if you want to get good at this then many of the competitive programming websites have a lot of tutorials and stuff I would recommend the book (How to solve it by computing) as a fairly simpler introduction to competitive programming and algorithms if the resources online are overwhelming. Some good competitive programming websites would be topcoder, codeforces (where the really top and over enthusiastic guys hang around) these people are really hardcore and solve a lot of problems and they have an excellent problem set for you to solve it, then we have hackerrank and codechef which attracts a lot of Indian crown so if you want to talk to people from your own country for some reason you could try here, there are other lesser known ones you could try atcoder, project Euler, spoj etc which you can check out, I would recommend selecting the websites that you like and then going from there but unless your job is going to be heavily dependent on data structures or algorithm level problems I'm not too sure if they would be useful in your day to day job (they help you get through your interviews easily though) but it's still fun to learn."", 'Totally hobbyist coder, transitioning in to a freelancer.

So I live in Ghaziabad (Delhi NCR basically) and I am now passed out from this school. I went to buy some stuff a hour earlier and these dogs attacked me. As I am good with dogs I was able to save myself. But it reminded me of something that happened in our school 3 years ago. And it really makes my blood boil that the situation isn't any better. These dogs have been a nuisance for a long time. And before I get hate I want to tell you I am a huge dog lover and I was used to feed strays all the time in my ex society. Just think how these kids must be feeling going to school everyday with a disfigured face which was no fault of theirs. Their poor parents complained to the municipality office but they didn't do shit. Some of us can deal with dogs but just think of a kid or your little brother. His first reflex would be to run and God knows what he can do. My neighbour comes home late from work every night and he is always feels threatened that one day a dog may bite him and this is the problem with India as a whole we just wait for something bad to happen before taking any action. Its pretty frustrating to not be able to go for a morning walk without feeling safe.

And politicians like Maneka Gandhi who probably have never stepped out of her car doesn't know what problem these dogs pose to two wheeler owners and pedestrians. 

I also understand that I can't demonize all stray dogs because some stray dogs are aggressive but do you have a better solution. And look I am a leftist humanist and whatever so I do believe in equality but equality is a vague term. Equality means equality of equals you can't go and ask for reservations that SC/ST gets on the argument that you both are human and equal. So don't give me shit like dogs are equal and tbfh they are not I do agree that they have the right to coexist with us in this planet but humans are the priority and there is no denying that. If you think dog life equal human life you should probably wake from your damn utopia. People like this piss me the most saying ""oh but you can't do that if a human kills or rapes someone you can't wipe of humanity"" but you sure can wipe out that human. In simple words stray dogs are pests that threaten humans and should be dealt with the most humane way possible I also don't support mass killing but people who think there is no problem I hope you get fucking biten.

I think people should report aggressive dogs and they should be killed without any protests through injections.
All females need to be sterilized and all dogs should get vaccinated and stuff so we can decrease chance of rabies.
As population goes down shelters should be built to keep them in the shelters and awareness should be spread that how low maintenance they are and they make a great pet (which is true my dad had one).", ,"[""The entire problem is created by Maneka Gandhi and until people start reporting this more, and create a big issue over this, it'll not get solved. People are bigger dog lovers than human lovers and are the ones that stop municipality workers from relocating dogs or taking them to shelters. The dog population is rising unchecked and obviously catch and release isn't working well at all. There needs to be some form of intervention."", 'Feeding strays is not animal love.

548,g7287d,Need dating advice from fellow Indians,0,"Hey everyone, 22M here 

I know this is not the type of post you would see on here regularly but I don’t know where else to go for advice 

So being a 22 year old guy I obviously use tinder, it never really meant anything I just kept swiping on profiles for no reason but all that changed when I matched with a girl back in November 2019. 

I’ve always thought that relationships were stupid and I’ve never been in one but she changed my view on that, we started dating in December and things were going great but due to reasons I don’t want to mention we broke up in early March, it’s been almost 2 months now and I think I’m finally over her (this was my first relationship) 

I now realise how amazing relationships can be and now I want to be in one and make it work.As of now I’ve deleted tinder because I find it to be stupid due to the massive difference in sex ratio and also I can’t match with the women I find attractive, I just have to sit around and wait hoping that they will swipe on me. I want to change that, I want to take initiative and go out and meet women on my own, I don’t want to depend on online dating 

And here’s the thing I don’t know how to do that. I’m an introverted person and I’m very shy due to this I have very few friends who are also introverted and don’t have much experience in dating. One of my friends suggested that I go to bar and meet women, I’ve never been to a bar before and I don’t drink either but I’m open to that and also I don’t know how to approach women at a bar because I feel indian girls are unlikely to talk to me if I approach them because I’m a stranger, I might be wrong here idk 

I have a cousin who’s a 28M and he’s never been in a relationship and he always keeps blaming women that they’re only after your money and nothing else, due to this mindset he’s been single all his life and doesn’t see the faults within him and since he keeps blaming them he doesn’t take the initiative to change. I really don’t want to end up like him ( lonely and sad ) 

I would really appreciate if you guys can help me out regarding this or share some similar experiences maybe 

And also if there are women reading this, I’d love some advice on how to approach you 

Thank you for reading ! And also please no social distancing jokes, I understand the situation right now

552,g6md1z,Geopolitics of Bangladesh liberation war - Why India initially didn't want East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh) to gain independence from West Pakistan (modern day Pakistan ),19,"I was researching on this subject recently which revealed some interesting points about the Bangladesh liberation war and the indo Pakistan 1971 war

**1) Indira Gandhi government was of opinion that east Bangladeshi parties coming to power in combined Pakistan assembly would moderate west Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir**

So , I need to give a little background . Before the Bangladesh liberation war really gathered steam , a student protest had already broken our in West and east Pakistan against dictator Ayub Khan . The movement demanded the restoration of democracy in combined Pakistan . When the situation became too hot to handle , the Pakistani military stepped in and deposed Ayub khan . It was decided to hold elections soon .

Now , you need to know that population wise , the population of Bangladeshis in east Pakistan was numerically greater than population of West Pakistan . 

In the elections that followed that , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his party Awami league won a landslide victory in East Pakistan . They won almost every seat in East Pakistan (awami league lost only 2 seats ) and emerged as the single largest party in combined Pakistan national assembly.Bhutto and his People's party were the second largest but nowhere near majority.

This was a shock election results for the Pakistani military establishment and Bhutto who had thought that west Pakistani dominance in national assembly was inevitable.

The Indian government found this result as optimistic for India . We thought that the Bengali politicians of East Pakistan would care less about Kashmir and would start an era of better relationship with India . Thus as a result , in the initial days of the liberation movement , India wasn't really keen on an independent Bangladesh as that would mean an even more rabid west Pakistan with regards to Kashmir 

**2) Indira Gandhi government was afraid of leftist elements in Bangladeshi independence movement . She was afraid that once they attain independence , they will give support to the Maoist - naxal insurgency raging in West Bengal**

The cold war geopolitics had caused Pakistan to join the side of capitalist America and the west . 

Meanwhile in India , a Maoist insurgency was raging in West Bengal and East India .

Indira Gandhi and her government was afraid that once Bangaldesh attained independence , the left elements involved in the liberation movement would give refuge and support to the Maoist insurgents in West Bengal ( which was not currently happening since Pakistan was on the American side )

As a result , members of Indira Gandhi government were of opinion that it was better if east Pakistan remained part of Pakistan 

**3) Soviet Union was afraid that an independent Bangladesh would be a Chinese ally**

Before the liberation movement , the sino-soviet split had taken place . The communist world was taking the side of either China or Soviet Union .

Soviet Union was afraid that the Maoist section of the Bangaldesh liberation movement would push them towards the China camp .

As a result , Soviet Union warned India against any drastic action in Bangladesh .

They kept this position until Indira Gandhi herself went to Moscow and held a 5 hour meeting with the top leader to brief them on the ongoing genocide in East Pakistan (operation searchlight ) . She also reminded them of their obligation under Indo-Soviet friendship treaty . It was after this meeting that Soviet Union finally changed their position and sided with India 

**4) America was afraid that break up of Pakistan would derail the ongoing negotiations between China - USA which was being done via Pakistan . As a result Nixon threatened India that any war against Pakistan will be expensive for India**

The green Revolution hadn't taken place yet . India had a ship to mouth existence where American aid to poor countries like India kept us afloat . America used to send food package and other relief measures to India regularly . 

If America had suspended those relief packages and placed sanctions on us , we would have been in great trouble . On top of those  , if they had placed more sanctions on us , our economic system would have collapsed .

As a result , we had to take any decision seriously.", ,"[""Thanks for this! Was interesting.

The fixed cap on the cost for private tests, however, is almost half of that in India. “All COVID tests in public sector are 100 percent free to patients, and all testing so far is in public sector,” Ravindra Rannan-Eliya, the executive director of the Institute of Health Policy—an independent non-profit working on issues concerning Sri Lanka’s health and social policies—wrote to me in an emailed response. “Private laboratories are allowed to test,\xa0 but there is a price ceiling imposed. It is around LKR 6,000”—which amounts to approximately Rs 2,400. “I understand that none have actually started doing this”—he said, referring to private laboratories— “and they all refer tests to public sector.”\n\nHmm, I wonder what's better, a country where a private test will theoretically cost you 2250 rupees but in reality there have been 0 private tests done or a country where it might cost more but has actually done tests.\n\nAnyway economics 101 tells us that price controls are invariably a bad idea. If you don't let the price reflect the true demand you cannot signal to the manufacturers to ramp up supply. The ideal way to do this is to tell the private labs that the govt will reimburse the cost of testing (with a price cap) which incentivises supply and will lead to the best case scenario, one of rapidly increasing supply of tests."", 'It also free in government hospitals where most of the tests are happening right now']",Coronavirus

589,g6bq7x,Hello. Brazilian here with some question about coronavirus in India.,66,"How are things going? I hope everything it's ok.

Yesterday I received a video on Whatsapp presenting data about the coronavirus in your country.

The narrator showed interesting statics regarding number of infection and deaths from the new virus. It seems India has a relatively low death rate per million if comparing with other dense populations nations. 

The video attribute these lower rates of death and infection to a homeopathic intervention. 

I have a very scientific mind and it wasn't easy to believe or process this kind of information so I thought it would be wiser to just ask you guys what's happening.

Herd Threshold is dependent on the size of the population. Greater the population sample greater the number. \n\n""R.zero"" typical number of infections passed on by an infectious person. A measure of person to person transmission within herd/community.\n\nWhen a person or a group of persons are part of an immune herd then the probability of spread depends on the Herd Threshold and the R.zero factor. Chances of an infection spread decrease within a community with larger density of immune people. This can protect those without immunity. People who are affected with the infection will be acting as barriers to spreaders. They may carry but won\'t spread.  In disease elimination this can be achieved to eradicate the infection within the community if appropriate or slightly higher than required threshold can be reached.', 'Herd Immunity is a phenomena seen when a high percentage of individuals within a population have developed immunity to a pathogen.

**Tl;dr**

The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has sought to revise its Request for Proposals (RFP) for tender bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) according to an update on its website dated March 23, 2020. IFF has previously called for a three year moratorium on the government use of facial recognition technologies under its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In this instance, we have shared a representation with the NCRB and the Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs Mr Amit Shah. In it, we highlight legal and constitutional issues with such projects. As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.   


**Background on AFRS**

The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:  


1. Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs,
2. Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),
3. Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA ,
4. Women and Child Development Ministry's KhoyaPaya Portal,
5. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA
6. Any other image database available with police/other entities.  


The NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/)).  However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB.  According to an [**update**](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender/AFRS.pdf) dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.  


As pointed out in our previous [**blogpost**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/) on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected.

**Steps taken by IFF**  


IFF has sought a [**three year moratorium**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-the-government-seeking-a-3-year-moratorium-on-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-india-projectpanoptic/) to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a [**legal notice**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/) to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.

In this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:  


1. NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System.
2. The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology
3. The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems.
4. The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.  


**What’s Next?**

IFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.

> Netflix has unlocked a selection of educational documentary films and series — available now for free on YouTube — saying it’s a way to help teachers and students during the COVID-19 quarantine.

> “Period. End of Sentence.” (Short Film): Director Rayka Zehtabchi tells the story of women in a rural village outside Delhi, India, who learn to manufacture and market their own sanitary pads.

About the film: https://www.news18.com/news/movies/period-end-of-sentence-review-this-netflix-documentary-is-aspirational-in-principle-impactful-in-general-2034769.html

> Rayka Zehtabchi’s short directorial is aimed at unwrapping stigma, fear, insecurity, ignorance and bad education, inherent in a woman’s life. Her tool--a humble looking sanitary pad. The film opens inside a room, two girls in their adolescent years, shying away when asked to talk about menstruation. 

> As is revealed, we all know of it but we don’t talk about it. “Menstruation is the biggest taboo in India”, points out Arunachalam Murauganantham, the social activist from Coimbatore, who is leading the crusade of making India into a 100 per cent sanitary napkin using country.

> We meet characters that champion the filmmaker’s cause. We are introduced to Sneha, Rekha, Shabana and other unnamed heroes of the film that are entrepreneurial, self-sufficient, smart and empathetic. Here, they are not dealing with issues limited only to their village, but are shouting out at the ones that are much bigger than them.

703,g6o9rw,Is democracy right for India?,0,"This is just meant to be a ""what-if"" post and nothing to be taken serious. This is to promote a healthy debate.
I in no way support dictatorship, authoritarianism or anything like that. I am very proud of our democratic traditions however flawed they might be, you can't deny they have held well since independence and I hope they stay strong forever. This can be said to be a case study.

So Iets start with China which have a single party authoritative form of government. And if you compare our economies till 1980 things were pretty similar. Similar populations, similar gdp, similar poverty levels etc. But in just 30 years China have literally left us in the dust in matters of economy and there is no denying that. Now, I do think we have done pretty well ourselves but it's not enough considering our huge population. The thing is whatever you say about the lack of freedom in China etc etc. There government get things done. For eg. How they cleaned up Beijing's pollution problem with a good laid out effective plan. That's a huge flaw of democracy. The time it takes to reach a conclusion is often devastatingly slow. Now, ofcourse I think democracy is the better form of government as people get to participate in the decision making process. But here stems the first question,
 
Do you think it's good for a country LIKE India?
Once you reach a certain level of development I think democracy is a better choice but do you think for a country like India or a  third world country, a country that is just corrupt and have many problems. Will democracy be a good choice. I mean I can't name many third world countries that became developed following democratic principles (The West is definitely not developed due to democracy. Yeah colonialism I am looking at you.) I think you need a government which can make decisions quick and effectively. Now the whole problem with this is that if we give power to a single party or person no one gets to question them and they can abuse their power for their own benefit. So it can go two ways, Either you get someone like Mao Zedong (Who is a fucking moron) or a Deng Xiaoping (Who is a fucking legend. Literally pulled China out of the junk.) So the second question is,

If you get a smart dictator (like Deng Xiaoping) will you prefer an authoritarian government?
Now with all this will definitely come a problem of shutting a few mouths and stuff as there will always be opposition to change. So some civil liberties will be naturally be curbed in a government of this type. So the third question is, 

Will you be willing to trade your civil liberties with a guarantee that the regime will make the country developed?

We can see examples of this in the Four Asian Tigers. Let's restrict it to South Korea and Singapore. Singapore had a great dictator in Lee Kuan. He changed a small country's destiny in a few decades. (Deng Xiaoping proved it can be done on a larger scale as well). And then you look at South Asia which isn't doing great at all! We have Sri Lanka with their civil war. Pakistan with their Coup. Nepal which isn't doing well and Bangladesh isn't doing well either. Also South Korea later turned to a democracy and I think they are doing great. So the last question is,

Will you accept an authoritarian government if it will turn to a democracy later when things settle down?
(Though this is rare)

So tell me what you think guys! I just want India to be a country that the world appreciate. Because undoubtedly there is no country in the world that will be as great as India once it is a developed country.", ,"[""What's the point if the world starts appreciating us but we lose all our freedoms?"", ""No other way to keep so many ethnicities, religions and class groups working together, I'm afraid.\n\nAnd no way of ensuring that the Indian Mao doesn't kill us all."", 'WE  👏 NEED 👏 EDUCATIONAL 👏 REFORMS 👏 PERIOD.', 'Get this commie outta here.

But the main problem is of antibody test kits which we have to import from other countries.

Now,
Why India is not able to get sufficient antibody kits ,is it due to shortage of funds ,less seriousness of this pandemic or some other reason.

How Maharashtra government has been able to test more compared to other states ?? How are they able to procure test kits more compared to Madhya Pradesh or other states ?", ,"['Antibody tests kits are available but these are mostly Chinese, issue with these is that quite a few of them are not working properly. Govt procurement is taking time, some states are moving faster than others.', 'For testing to ramp up, medical bodies like icmr need to accurately determine the accuracy of the test results. With bad accuracy more testing will lead to a disaster', 'Scarcity of will power.', ""Some states (specifically one ...WB) is a slice of China so they refuse to test despite having kits and censor doctors and also fudge the actual number of cases for better optics. \n\n\nSome other states genuinely don't have the testing kits , these are mostly the North eastern states however the number of SARI cases and deaths are really low there so it's safe to assume the virus didn't spread as much. \n\n\nBig hotspots (basically the 6 big cities) have more kits diverted towards them since a higher population density in cities will lead to really high R0 . Except Kolkata ofcourse cuz of the point 1. \n\n\nOverall the govt doesn't have enough kits to begin with as it is. I don't know what exactly happened with MyLab since we haven't heard from them since their initial declaration/announcement. Most kits especially rapid testing kits from China were defective (color me surprised! As if people didn't expect this was going to happen after it happened with Spain, Germany and Italy)."", ""Testing has been significantly ramped up. A month ago, it was 17 tests per million and now it's 335.   \nWe have done a total of 4.6 L tests which makes up at par with several countries from EU. If you're expecting that we test all 1.3 B people in India, then you're expectations are misplaced as it's practically not possible and financially not viable for a country like us.   \nWhat we are following is a two way approach. Initially we did targetted testing to identify hotspots. And now, in those hotspots where severity is high, we are going all-in on asymptomatic testing. Quite effective and optimal way of dealing with Covid for a country that has population of 1.3 B.

 I'll sacrifice my desires to please others because there's an ingrained feeling that I'm worthless. It's this irrepressible desire to appease others. That craving for approval maddens me.

I find no joy in my achievements because I tend to compare myself with others. It's indubitable that there'll always be people more successful than us. Intellectually I understand it but unable to internalise it. My acquaintances encourage me to utter affirmations. But they've been sterile. Utterly ineffective.


My passive-aggression repels me. Until not too long ago I wasn't aware of my tendencies. A good samaritan sat me down and elucidated what I was suffering from. I started dispassionately observing my behaviour and I've sensed a pit in my stomach when I don't receive the approval I crave.
I'm encouraged to love myself. But it's a cryptic expression. I've watched countless videos by these soi-disant motivators. The more I watch them the more I hate myself. I've been encouraged to visit mental health professionals. But I cannot at this stage.

Baba Ramdev, further shows how one can make an Ayurvedic hand sanitizer at home on India TV. Through this, you can make a hand sanitizer to avoid coronavirus. After thorough research by Baba Ramdev, this domestic and Ayurvedic hand sanitizer has been declared authentic. They say that it is absolutely herbal and it does not have any side effects. Have a look at how to make a home hand sanitizer.

**Ingredients:**

1-liter water

100 neem leaves10-20 basil leaves10 grams alum10 grams camphorAloe vera

&#x200B;

**Procedure**:

* First, put 100 grams of neem leaves in 1 liter of water.
* After that, add basil leaves and boil them well in water. Now put aloe vera in it.
* When the water boils well and about 600 to 700 mL of 1 liter is left, then add camphor and alum in it.

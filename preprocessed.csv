0,Fuck all Religion,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

The media is clearly not truthful on either sides and have been manipulating citizens of both countries for years. 
I just came here to tell you guys that not all Pakistanis hate India and I know not all Indians hate Pakistan. However, we can all agree that both countries have different political differences but we don't hate the people. 
I currently live in the US and I have a lot of Indian friends. We are like family now. It's come to the point that we usually forget that we are from two different countries who hate each other. To us we are all the same. We are all from different religious backgrounds as well but it doesn't matter to us, there is no hatred whatsoever.
We all watch cricket together and recently when India and Pakistan were versing each other we were all having a great time.
Politics and media has ruined us.

Let’s see.\n\nMad price discovery mechanisms in big Indian cities like Noida, Mumbai and Delhi.\n\nTo understand what has happened, let’s imagine there is a piece of land somewhere in Noida or Mumbai.\n\n\n\nThere are two parties willing to buy the land - one is a farmer, the other is a property developer.\n\nAs the demand for property in the market is much higher than the demand for food, the property developer is able to pay a higher interest rate to the bank.\xa0In other words, the property developer has a probability of making higher profits from the land than the farmer.\n\nNow, one might say there is nothing wrong here. But to see what’s wrong, we need to ask\xa0Why is the demand of property so high?\n\nThe simple people would say it’s because the population is growing, and land is limited, so the demand for property is high and growing.\n\nBut if you dig deep, you realise there are two reasons the demand of property is high in our country.\xa0Based on the reason causing the demand, we can divide the demand for property into two - the organic demand and the speculation driven demand.\n\nWhen people buy house to live in, it’s organic demand. But\xa0when people buy houses not to live, but to make money, it’s speculation driven demand.\n\nSo the demand for property in big cities of India is not high because people want to live and for that they need houses, the demand for properties is high because people are buying multiple properties to earn money.\n\nLet’s go back to our example - as the demand for property is artificially high, the property developer can make a lot of money from the land.\xa0The banks (or other funds) want to earn money as well, so they give loan not to the farmer, but to the property developer.\n\nThis ruins the economy in multiple ways -\xa0First, it increases the artificial demand for land and property even more, driving the cycle further. Second, it creates supply of things without organic demand. Big buildings are being constructed but the working class of our country can’t afford the houses, specially in big cities.\xa0The law of supply-and-demand has been killed due to the speculation driven artificial liquidity injection.\xa0Third, it increases the wealth gap by boosting asset prices. Forth, because the banks are more willing to fund speculative investments instead of real economic activity, the employment creation is low in the long run. So you see this gap between GDP Growth and employment in India.\xa0Fifth, the Indian banks are dead inside. We will see this in next point.\n\nIndian Banks are toast\n\nGoing back to our example - the bank has now given loan to the property developer. Everything looks fine they will say. What can go wrong?\n\nThe health of the bank look really nice. They have an asset paying them 6%. And in case the property developer fails, the bank can always take over the property and sell it, recovering all the money.\xa0Nothing can go wrong. It’s all safe. Right? NO.\n\nRemember the two types of demand - the organic demand and speculation driven demand.\n\n\n\nSee the cycle described above. You will see why Indian banks are finished. Everything is fine until it’s not.\xa0Suddenly there will be an explosion in the banking system, banks will start failing one after the other.\n\nRemember the high property prices were created by the money injections by the banks (and private funds) themselves.\xa0The banks fund the purchase and development of properties.\n\nIndian banks are already in trouble. This cycle has started, it will take some more time to blow up. You wouldn't see this till it’s too late.\n\n\n\nThat’s why we have unfinished property crisis in big cities, the developers can’t borrow more to finish the development.\n\nWhat do we learn here -\xa0The property prices are not going up because of lack of land or growing population, but due to money being injected into the system by reckless banks.\n\nHow careless banks created the job crisis of India - why India can’t create massive scale, permanent good paying jobs for its youth.\n\nLet’s go back to our example. The farmer was unable to get the loan and land not because what he was doing was useless, it was because his industry didn’t had a banking system and speculative investors creating artificial demand.\n\nIf he owned the land, he would be producing food for the people living in the area. Not only did the bank’s and investors’ careless practices increased the housing and land prices in the area, it also kicked out the other productive people and entrepreneurs from the locality.\n\nIn an ideal case, the bank should be lending to various sectors of the economy. This would increase production of useful goods and services and increase the prosperity of the locality.\n\nBut because of the bank’s incentive to earn a lot of money, they give a lot of loan to a few people, in a few cities, in a few industries. This increase wealth inequality.\n\nSo the farmer that could have created a good agri business and good productive jobs for a lot of people is now himself working as a real-estate agent.\n\nAnd what happens when the property bubble goes bust? The people working in the industry will lose jobs. All the workers, labourers, will be out of work.\n\nSo the banks are, instead of creating long term productive jobs, funding the creation of temporary jobs in speculative industries, while harming entrepreneurs by increasing the cost of borrowing and running a business.\n\nSo you see the GDP is going up, Sensex is up but employment is not.\n\nWhy government is pushing for a cashless economy?\n\nCause the banks are toast. As soon as banking system goes down, everyone will start pulling cash out of the bank, creating what we call a “bank run”.\nBank’s don’t have the cash to pay everyone, cause they give out the cash in loans. They take deposits from you, keep a tiny part of it as reserves and give out the rest as loans.\n\nSo if everyone starts pulling out their money from the bank all at once, banks will explode, as they don’t have money.\n\nThe solution? Cashless economy !\n\nDid you notice,\xa0there is no way for someone to get out of the banking system in a 100% cashless economy.Your money will always be in the banking system. Money can only move from one account to another. You can never pull your money out of the banking system.\n\nModi is pushing for a cashless economy to keep you trapped in the banking system.\xa0The banking system is dead inside and needs your money to survive.\n\nDemonetisation was done to push the money outside the banking system into the system. Demonetisation was done to protect the banks.\n\n\n\nGovernment’s Big Scam - The taxpayer bailout of careless rich people\n\n\n\nThe Modi government is using your tax money to bail-out the careless banks, private investors and rich big-city home buyers.\n\nIt’s a scam. The Indian government is stealing your money, and you are happy because Modi is destroying Pakistan.\xa0Only thing these guys are destroying is your money.\n\nHer argument is “I want to help the home buyers”\n\nIf these home-buyers earn money, does the common tax payers get that money? No.\nSo if these people face losses, why should the tax payer take the hit?\n\nPrivatised profits and socialised losses. Whenever something terrible happens, this lady is always involved.\n\nMumbai and Delhi are toast\n\n\nWhat you can do -\n\nStop making rich people rich. Stop watching movies. Stop buying luxurious things. Stop feeding the monster.\n\nDon’t keep your money in small banks.\n\nBuy local things, or things made by small and mid-size companies.\n\nBuy only what’s needed.\n\nDon’t waste your time watching mainstream media.

Let’s see.\n\nMad price discovery mechanisms in big Indian cities like Noida, Mumbai and Delhi.\n\nTo understand what has happened, let’s imagine there is a piece of land somewhere in Noida or Mumbai.\n\n\n\nThere are two parties willing to buy the land - one is a farmer, the other is a property developer.\n\nAs the demand for property in the market is much higher than the demand for food, the property developer is able to pay a higher interest rate to the bank.\xa0In other words, the property developer has a probability of making higher profits from the land than the farmer.\n\nNow, one might say there is nothing wrong here. But to see what’s wrong, we need to ask\xa0Why is the demand of property so high?\n\nThe simple people would say it’s because the population is growing, and land is limited, so the demand for property is high and growing.\n\nBut if you dig deep, you realise there are two reasons the demand of property is high in our country.\xa0Based on the reason causing the demand, we can divide the demand for property into two - the organic demand and the speculation driven demand.\n\nWhen people buy house to live in, it’s organic demand. But\xa0when people buy houses not to live, but to make money, it’s speculation driven demand.\n\nSo the demand for property in big cities of India is not high because people want to live and for that they need houses, the demand for properties is high because people are buying multiple properties to earn money.\n\nLet’s go back to our example - as the demand for property is artificially high, the property developer can make a lot of money from the land.\xa0The banks (or other funds) want to earn money as well, so they give loan not to the farmer, but to the property developer.\n\nThis ruins the economy in multiple ways -\xa0First, it increases the artificial demand for land and property even more, driving the cycle further. Second, it creates supply of things without organic demand. Big buildings are being constructed but the working class of our country can’t afford the houses, specially in big cities.\xa0The law of supply-and-demand has been killed due to the speculation driven artificial liquidity injection.\xa0Third, it increases the wealth gap by boosting asset prices. Forth, because the banks are more willing to fund speculative investments instead of real economic activity, the employment creation is low in the long run. So you see this gap between GDP Growth and employment in India.\xa0Fifth, the Indian banks are dead inside. We will see this in next point.\n\nIndian Banks are toast\n\nGoing back to our example - the bank has now given loan to the property developer. Everything looks fine they will say. What can go wrong?\n\nThe health of the bank look really nice. They have an asset paying them 6%. And in case the property developer fails, the bank can always take over the property and sell it, recovering all the money.\xa0Nothing can go wrong. It’s all safe. Right? NO.\n\nRemember the two types of demand - the organic demand and speculation driven demand.\n\n\n\nSee the cycle described above. You will see why Indian banks are finished. Everything is fine until it’s not.\xa0Suddenly there will be an explosion in the banking system, banks will start failing one after the other.\n\nRemember the high property prices were created by the money injections by the banks (and private funds) themselves.\xa0The banks fund the purchase and development of properties.\n\nIndian banks are already in trouble. This cycle has started, it will take some more time to blow up. You wouldn't see this till it’s too late.\n\n\n\nThat’s why we have unfinished property crisis in big cities, the developers can’t borrow more to finish the development.\n\nWhat do we learn here -\xa0The property prices are not going up because of lack of land or growing population, but due to money being injected into the system by reckless banks.\n\nHow careless banks created the job crisis of India - why India can’t create massive scale, permanent good paying jobs for its youth.\n\nLet’s go back to our example.

Literally no one was caring too much about politics etc, (there were some protests or something going on too but I just assume its everywhere in India). \n\nKerala is still among the top places i visited in the world for what I saw. everyone was malayalee/indian it was no I am a muslim first, I am a hindu first.

187,Hi r/India! I wanted to share this piece I finished this morning of my granduncle in Punjab,,"['""Beyond every bend""\noil on canvas\n36""x36""\n\nThis is painting of my granduncle who I visit almost every year in India. He has always been a very cheerful and jolly man, almost like my own santa growing up.  During my recent visit in 2016, he was not the same.  He would often come around the village with his grandchildren around his shoulders. This time I would go to visit him, in a small room on the side of the road. The room was connected to the larger family house but there was a sense of isolation and exclusion there. \n\nI think he was alone, away from his family. He had lost about 50 lbs and was not able to communicate any sort of happy expression. He sat up when he saw me but deep down, there was an underlying loneliness I could relate to. It was almost like he was just waiting for the end.\n\nI can relate to that deep sense of not belonging and often try to communicate it through some of my portraiture. It is in many ways baffling to me how we can be moving inward together, at the same time, not knowing we are not going through it alone.  Unfortunately, I feel at times my culture has been a factor in that. Things are often unsaid and misunderstood. I\'ve grown up not knowing how to express internal conflict and struggle because it just wasn\'t something practiced at the family table. Eventually I would like to create enough work for exhibits and to bring some light to issues of mental health to the general public but also to my own culture.   \n\nThe goal of the painting was to portray the overall mood so I started the painting with a large brush to cover the initial layer. 99% of the painting after that was in palette knife. The knife allows me to create movement, texture, and atmosphere in a few sessions instead of having to layer with a brush.', ""I don't know why but this reminds me so much of [this image](http://www.culturalindia.net/iliimages/Bhagat-Singh-ili-24-img-5.jpg) of Bhagat Singh"", 'Always loved the Punjabi getup and persona, your granduncle and your painting really personified both!

The drivers are all corrupt, 8/10 (bangalore) they will call you up to ask for your destination (which they are not supposed to know) then if they dont like it or if you refuse to tell them they will waste your time sitting in some gully trying to force you to cancel. Yes, it is 8 times out of 10, i am not exaggerating.

Pizza hut, dominos, other international chains: Completely 100% indianized, only chicken (religous issue? even UAE pizza hut has pork on their menu), KFC removes fries from its menu (but they sell burgers, wtf? and fries are known, world around, to be the highest margin fast food item).

Electricians, handymen, plumbers: never on time, show up whenever they want, get upset when you say you are now busy. Cant install taps correctly (hot is cold, cold is hot), too near the sink so to get water on your hands you have to touch the sink, poor earthing.

ISPs: shit customer service all-round, high speed, yes, but poor connections with high latency, blocking of websites (disgusting to freedom of information)

Mobile service providers: cheap AF, completely overbooked, infrastructure cant cater to the number of people they take on, get 0.2mbps 4g in metros like mg road bangalore even at 2 o clock on a weekday night.

Autos: meter is just for show, at least in bangalore, aggressive, misbehaved if you dont haggle with them off the meter. Dont even know the roads properly.

The problem is that once you start offering tradespeople extra premium to do high quality work, even then these people end up doing sub-standard work. So, this is not completely a function of low pay; the skills are way sub-par too.\n\nb. Attention to detail is tremendously low here.\n\nc.

In Japan, it’s shame that needles people to have high standards. In the US, it’s the heavy costs on irregularities (legal recourse and lawsuits for anything). We have neither, and we are poor and desperate to bend everything to our advantage. \n\nLike you alluded to: in a poor society, work culture, decency, quality shouldn’t be its corollaries. Rather they should be prime motivators to move out of it.', ""We don't have much real love for the country. We will trash Pakisthanis online and throw waste here and there. Some of it is justified because it is already shitty. But still when we think it is like what difference can one person make?\n\nAlso, no one abuses good systems like us. A few years ago, my colleague wore a beautiful necklace for a celebration. When another colleague asked her to lend it to her for some family function, she said that she had returned it. She bought it from Amazon, used it and returned the product. Obviously, she was misusing the full refund, no questions asked policy."", 'Well yeah, Vietnam has similar average income to India, but does everything better. Things are in order, streets are cleaner, business cares about customer, nobody is burning anyone else over religion, they also do very well in international academic competitions. People work hard, study hard, and read books. \n\nThe next rising economy is going to be Vietnam. They are like the little China back then, with everything else other than money on a higher level, so money would flow in eventually. \n\nIndia is a real $2,000 GDP per capita country. All the shit about religion and other stuff happening in India also happen in those African countries on similar level. Go visit China, Vietnam, Kenya, and Nigeria, and you’ll see.

We have a plumber who feels comfortable asking for half a day's pay because that's what it takes him to commute to come to my place and fix a few things. I have no problem.

One time a cop showed up wasted more of my time than doing anything, takes my picture for some reason, and fucks off.

Even other poorer nations, and other 3rd world countries, are not as shit as ours when it comes to decenly and proper service, public behaviour, etc. This is the shittiest country in the world, to be honest, fuck your Indian pride (proud of what?).

goddamned cesspool ['First time?', 'Had the same problem when I moved from USA to India. I can proffer you the following reasons:- \n\na. Extremely cost sensitive market. The problem is that once you start offering tradespeople extra premium to do high quality work, even then these people end up doing sub-standard work. So, this is not completely a function of low pay; the skills are way sub-par too.\n\nb. Attention to detail is tremendously low here.\n\nc. Indians tend to not go deeply into things and really understand things  on superficial level.', 'When a society wants to pay AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE for everything, eventually all products and services reflect that and become barely usable.', 'Uber, Ola: Aggregators have made the margins so narrow on the driver partners, that the drivers have reduced the level of service across the platform. \n\nSwiggy, zomato etc - Same problem.', 'Basically, no pride in getting the job done, and no decency. In Japan, it’s shame that needles people to have high standards. In the US, it’s the heavy costs on irregularities (legal recourse and lawsuits for anything). We have neither, and we are poor and desperate to bend everything to our advantage. \n\nLike you alluded to: in a poor society, work culture, decency, quality shouldn’t be its corollaries. Rather they should be prime motivators to move out of it.', ""We don't have much real love for the country. We will trash Pakisthanis online and throw waste here and there. Some of it is justified because it is already shitty. But still when we think it is like what difference can one person make?\n\nAlso, no one abuses good systems like us. A few years ago, my colleague wore a beautiful necklace for a celebration. When another colleague asked her to lend it to her for some family function, she said that she had returned it. She bought it from Amazon, used it and returned the product. Obviously, she was misusing the full refund, no questions asked policy."", 'Well yeah, Vietnam has similar average income to India, but does everything better. Things are in order, streets are cleaner, business cares about customer, nobody is burning anyone else over religion, they also do very well in international academic competitions. People work hard, study hard, and read books. \n\nThe next rising economy is going to be Vietnam. They are like the little China back then, with everything else other than money on a higher level, so money would flow in eventually. \n\nIndia is a real $2,000 GDP per capita country. All the shit about religion and other stuff happening in India also happen in those African countries on similar level. Go visit China, Vietnam, Kenya, and Nigeria, and you’ll see. Some countries are obviously above their level and will rise, some countries not so much.', ""I understand your ire, but permit me to give this a constructive twist.\n\n>*Apart from the obvious, trash everywhere ...*\n\nPerhaps you have seen the site [theuglyindian.com](https://theuglyindian.com)?  Don't be discouraged by the name. This is a cleanup of St Marks St in your city, and is a beautiful example of what it takes to have a lasting effect.  Then there's Afroz Shah and his beach/river cleanup efforts in Mumbai. There are people like that in every city, and they do work for which people are immensely grateful. I think it is quite empowering to be on the positive end of it. Do check out their Facebook page as well and join them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*Electricians, handymen, plumbers .....*\n\nIt has taken me a few years, but I have managed to track and retain good, prompt people. There are few proper karigars who do their job well, and it is possible to get their contacts by asking around sites of good builders for referrals. I pay very well, I don't haggle, and I tip the helpers generously. We have a plumber who feels comfortable asking for half a day's pay because that's what it takes him to commute to come to my place and fix a few things. I have no problem. In return, he takes his time, leaves the bathroom and kitchen cleaner than he found it, and fixes other things that I never asked to do in the first place.\n\n>*fuck your Indian pride (proud of what?)*\n\nI'm with you!

276,"All Indians are equal, but some are greater than others - by sanitarypanels",,"['Seriously, wealth and budget and are entirely different things. The budget can never ever exceed the wealth of billionaires or in fact the cumulative wealth of all citizens as well.\n\nBudget is only the government consumption and revenue nothing else.', ""This is a stupid comparison.\n\n\nBudget is every year. wealth is a one-time thing if you use all of it once you don't have anything next year.\n\n\nI'm not saying there is huge no inequality in India. These kinds of misinformation does more harm than good."", 'The US budget is 3.8 trillion, while their wealth of millionaires is 4-5 trillion. Just for comparison. Can provide links/working upon request.', 'This is what happens when someone who doesn\'t understand the difference between a flow and a stock tries to be cool. Wealth is a stock, represents a quantity at that point of time and budget is a flow, measured per year.\n\nAlso what a stupid title by OP. If accumulating wealth is that easy, kamake dikhao. This country will progress when people stop ""muh rich bad"" ""capitalism izz evil"". Yes, there\'s high income inequality to address, but blaming the croporates/rich isn\'t the solution', ""The richest 20 billionaires in America have a combined net worth of $732 billion. That’s more than the bottom half of the American population, or 152 million people\n\nSo what's the point, there are country with even less number and more money with them."", ""More socialism will solve India's problems. Sure."", 'I can never understand nonsense like this. What do they want? A totalitarian communist state where everyone has the same money irrespective of the work they do?\n\nHere\'s the deal. Human society in 2020 is structured in a way that different people perform different roles. We all influence each other and we wouldn\'t be able to continue without that. Therefore, our interactions are monetized in a way that people who influence more people positively, make more money.\n\nThis is a good thing. For all the shit that idealists throw at it, free market capitalism is one of the best inventions of the 20th century. And it is absolutely fair.\n\nCommunism essentially says this. You are born and you immediately deserve the same thing as everyone.\n\nCapitalism says, you are born and you will get value, equivalent to the amount of goods and services you give to someone else.\n\nThe former may ""seem"" fair, but it isn\'t.\n\nThe Bajaj family for instance, has almost 10 billion in wealth. They have this because the products and services they have built, influences that many individuals. It doesn\'t make any sense to posit that they don\'t deserve that money.

(Source: Twitter) Twitter has been buzzing with reactions to the news, with some saying that what the officer did was to be expected and should not be hailed as an achievement, while others lauded the policeman’s decision. (Source: Twitter)\n\nA policeman’s job in India is not an easy one. And though the police force is there to protect and help the citizens of this country – and they do so as well – there are times when they find themselves in a fix when dealing with VIPs. How many times have we seen policemen and women being hauled up for not giving preferential treatment to a bureaucrat or politician and the incident being caught on camera. Well, such problems don’t stop these lawmen from doing their duty, and one such example was of a Bengaluru traffic police officer, who stopped the President’s convoy so that an ambulance could pass through.\n\nTraffic police sub-inspector ML Nijalingappa, who was deployed at Bengaluru’s Trinity Circle on Saturday (June 17), has won hearts in the city and on social media alike for making way for an ambulance even as a convoy of the President of India was to pass through a busy junction. According to an ANI report, the Bengaluru Police later announced a reward for the policeman for making way for an ambulance during the convoy movement of President Pranab Mukherjee, who was in the city for the inauguration of Metro’s Green Line.\n\nMukherjee’s convoy was headed towards the Raj Bhavan when Nijalingappa is said to have spotted an ambulance trying to make its a way towards a private hospital near HAL. The sub-inspector directed his colleagues to help the ambulance travel through the traffic-heavy road.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic East Division, Bengaluru City, Abhei Goyal later took to Twitter to praise the officer’s presence of mind.\n\nPSI Sh Nijlingappa is rewarded for deftly allowing the ambulance before the 1st citizen of India. @blrcitytraffic gives way to ??, do you? pic.twitter.com/KoI2nap14N — DCP Traffic East (@DCPTrEastBCP) June 18, 2017\n\nPraveen Sood, the Commissioner of Police, tweeted, “The policeman who took such initiative to be rewarded.

(Source: Twitter) Twitter has been buzzing with reactions to the news, with some saying that what the officer did was to be expected and should not be hailed as an achievement, while others lauded the policeman’s decision. (Source: Twitter)\n\nA policeman’s job in India is not an easy one. And though the police force is there to protect and help the citizens of this country – and they do so as well – there are times when they find themselves in a fix when dealing with VIPs. How many times have we seen policemen and women being hauled up for not giving preferential treatment to a bureaucrat or politician and the incident being caught on camera. Well, such problems don’t stop these lawmen from doing their duty, and one such example was of a Bengaluru traffic police officer, who stopped the President’s convoy so that an ambulance could pass through.\n\nTraffic police sub-inspector ML Nijalingappa, who was deployed at Bengaluru’s Trinity Circle on Saturday (June 17), has won hearts in the city and on social media alike for making way for an ambulance even as a convoy of the President of India was to pass through a busy junction. According to an ANI report, the Bengaluru Police later announced a reward for the policeman for making way for an ambulance during the convoy movement of President Pranab Mukherjee, who was in the city for the inauguration of Metro’s Green Line.\n\nMukherjee’s convoy was headed towards the Raj Bhavan when Nijalingappa is said to have spotted an ambulance trying to make its a way towards a private hospital near HAL. The sub-inspector directed his colleagues to help the ambulance travel through the traffic-heavy road.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic East Division, Bengaluru City, Abhei Goyal later took to Twitter to praise the officer’s presence of mind.\n\nPSI Sh Nijlingappa is rewarded for deftly allowing the ambulance before the 1st citizen of India. @blrcitytraffic gives way to ??, do you? pic.twitter.com/KoI2nap14N — DCP Traffic East (@DCPTrEastBCP) June 18, 2017\n\nPraveen Sood, the Commissioner of Police, tweeted, “The policeman who took such initiative to be rewarded.

285,My relatives visited me. And I live with my girlfriend unbeknownst to them. And they lost their shit. And it was a thing of beauty. (Re-posting because violated some rules earlier),"Backstory: Last week I broke my ankle and there's a cast around it.  
And also, I tend to be one of the lucky guys in India who lives with his girlfriend. But also unlucky in the sense that a handful of my relatives also live in Delhi.

Here's a highlight of how my last 5 days have been when they visited

* Initially I had to endure gasps, shudders and shivers of them when they realize about my ""Living arrangement"" and how ""apposit Jendaars"" are not supposed to live together.

* Then I experienced a satisfaction almost equal to 1/10th of an orgasm when I saw their faces while they ""inform"" my dad(who couldn't give two shits about it. He's cool like that.)

* Then some other bullshit was uttered around me about homeopathy, patanjali or some pehelwan in some gali or chowk who can cure me within a minute.

* Then came a 2nd wave of gasps and horrific squeals when they realized there is no temple or statue at home.

* In the evening my girlfriend comes from work, so naturally my relatives **HAD** to know what her parents do, earn, spend, overpronate, underpronate???

* Then when they were checking out the rest of the house and saw that the bedroom is being shared (and this is the best part) they acted as if I've murdered their children.

* My bua also got disgusted when she found out I was washing both of ours clothes as it is *ladies* work (This is the only time I was legit pissed) 

* My gf has a full sleeve tattoo for which my maami had a questionnaire ready

* Honb'l mention- It was Navratri and the maid had prepared chicken and rice in Lunch so that was fun.

* Another honb'l mention: All of them know that I drink. Because I got many of my cousins drunk in a family wedding some years back. But when they found the bottles and asked me whether she drinks or not and when I said yes she does. Their immediate response was *But girls can't drink.*  
As if it's anatomically impossible for chicks to drink alcohol.

And I am 24 btw. Just for perspective for how ridiculous they are.

A few years ago, I thought that my aims were pretty sharp, and there is anyway a shooting academy so close to my place. So, I should at least go and try it. What if I am really good at it and I never knew?\n\nSo, I went there along with one of my friends to inquire about it. There were some people shooting in the shooting range, some students were being trained etc. It seemed pretty fun, so I went to the office to ask more details on how to join.\n\nAll I wanted was to see if I have any talent in this sport. The person in the office said that I will have to first take membership for the shooting academy which will either cost some 20k per year, or 50k for lifetime. I said that I am new to this, and all I want to do is try it for few days, and if I am good at it, I will register for the membership. He said that the only way to join is by taking these memberships.\n\nI was a student at that time, so I couldn't afford paying that much on my own, but I was earning a reasonable income from my websites, so if I wanted, I could take the membership.

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way

* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.

* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan

* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

* Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship.

It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries. [Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistan](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bangladesh-india-citizenship-amendment-bill-pak-afghanistan-modi-hasina-1628304-2019-12-14)


>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

In short, the act is discriminatory in nature as it clearly states that India is only interested in taking non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way

* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.

* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan

* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

* Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries. [Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistan](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bangladesh-india-citizenship-amendment-bill-pak-afghanistan-modi-hasina-1628304-2019-12-14)


>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

In short, the act is discriminatory in nature as it clearly states that India is only interested in taking non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Coupled with NRC, CAA will create a hostile environment for Indian Muslims where they will be at the complete mercy of the government.

336,Possible scam on the huge Youtube tech channel PhoneRadar. I am the winner. Need advice,"Hello everyone,

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 

Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 

Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 

Update 4: RIP inbox.

Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!

Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today.

349,"I made 13 illegal toll booth vanish overnight, milking 3-4 lakhs everyday, using RTI","For decades traveling from native village to the railway station I had been paying toll to cross a bridge, that only kelp on increasing year after year. There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. 

So I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.

Fun Fact: 

* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.

374,Does my period really makes me impure?,"I despise my periods not because they hurt me, but because of the amount of crappy rules I'm made to follow. It's unbelievable that people find it so hard to move on with time. If anyone of you have seen the movie padman, you know what I'm talking about. 

I am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.

It's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. 

Does my period really make me so impure?

Edit: Thank you for all the love and support! I honestly didn't know this was that big of a problem until you people pointed it out. Especially the not eating thing. I didn't know it can have long term effects. The problem with that is that if I force my mother to let me eat then she will make me stay in that hell disgusting room for whole 2 days. Sounds like a punishment for eating. 2 days doing nothing looking at walls. That disgusts me a lot I feel like a wasted body or something.","[""Holy shitt !! This is insane. Your mom needs to be counselled by someone close to her - maybe your dad or someone she is close to in your extended family or some close friend she confides in and trusts. Talk to this person and seek their help. However, keep it in mind that when he/she brings it up with your mom, it shouldn't look as if you complained about your mom. If that happens your mom may feel betrayed and the conversation won't get anywhere.\n\nThis being a hardcore religious dogma which is not easily susceptible to reason, she is likely to go into a defensive mindset if she is rebuked or pushed aggressively. So, the conversation has to be carefully thought out and the follies of her ways have to be explained to her in a very smooth and non-aggressive manner.\n\nIn the meantime, be brave girl !!"", ""I can't understand how parents can do this to their own children blinded my beliefs."", '[deleted]', ""This sounds a lot like my grand mother. My mother and sister used to loathe her ways. She would go to crazy lengths to stay pure or clean like bathing everytime she went out as she was taught doing these things would please God. What was even more crazy was in her quest, she would abandon all common sense and humanity. Unfortunately for you, logic does little for these people. I hope you don't grow to resent your mother. She's been programmed this way and this will take a lot of time to erode her ways. \n \nYou're not impure. Some of our customs are absolutely mind numbing. Stay strong. Maybe talk to someone who's sensible in these matters and ask them to help. \n \nI totally slipped past that first day thing. Regarding the first day, talk to your dad. Do anything to get through to him - cry, faint, vomit. This is just crazy. Or you could openly defy your mother. It will be a pain. Start small. Eat something infront of her, drink a little water, go out of the room. It will be tough but it can't be tougher than it already is. Remember to start with something small, expect the unexpected, stay strong, have someone to call like a brother or bf who understands for moral support. "", ""Sweetie no. This is so wrong on so many levels. I can give you more info in private if you'd like to discuss.  \n\nWe had rules like these but I stopped following them years ago.  I got mine at 12. I'm 24 now. I don't even tell my mom I'm on my period these days because of all the rules. But listen. YOU ARE NOT IMPURE. The rules were put in place, where women were asked not to cook, because they'll be weaker. This was the real reason. \n\nOver generations people have perverted that and made it an impurity thing. There is nothing impure about it. It is clean blood same as a nose bleed. The only difference is where it comes from. In fact, the vaginal canal is self-cleaning. If anything, it's cleaner than a nose bleed. \n\nBefore I get downvoted by some childish immature men, I'd like to talk to you and give you some more tips on how to handle this. The food thing is just.... TERRIBLE. on my first day I want to lie in bed and scream and cry and eat all the junk food I can lay my hands on. "", ""No it doesn't make you impure! \n\nAs Indians, we are screwed up beings. \n\nIf a girl can't get pregnant, shame her.   \nIf a girl has periods, isolate her.   \nIf a girl gets mishandled, blame her.    \n\n"", 'First of all, **NO, you are not impure**. \n\nThere is no such thing as pure impure.

I despise my periods not because they hurt me, but because of the amount of crappy rules I'm made to follow. It's unbelievable that people find it so hard to move on with time. If anyone of you have seen the movie padman, you know what I'm talking about. 

I am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.

It's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. 

Does my period really make me so impure?

Edit: Thank you for all the love and support! I honestly didn't know this was that big of a problem until you people pointed it out. Especially the not eating thing. I didn't know it can have long term effects. The problem with that is that if I force my mother to let me eat then she will make me stay in that hell disgusting room for whole 2 days. Sounds like a punishment for eating. 2 days doing nothing looking at walls. That disgusts me a lot I feel like a wasted body or something. [""Holy shitt !! This is insane. Your mom needs to be counselled by someone close to her - maybe your dad or someone she is close to in your extended family or some close friend she confides in and trusts. Talk to this person and seek their help. However, keep it in mind that when he/she brings it up with your mom, it shouldn't look as if you complained about your mom. If that happens your mom may feel betrayed and the conversation won't get anywhere.\n\nThis being a hardcore religious dogma which is not easily susceptible to reason, she is likely to go into a defensive mindset if she is rebuked or pushed aggressively. So, the conversation has to be carefully thought out and the follies of her ways have to be explained to her in a very smooth and non-aggressive manner.\n\nIn the meantime, be brave girl !!"", ""I can't understand how parents can do this to their own children blinded my beliefs."", '[deleted]', ""This sounds a lot like my grand mother. My mother and sister used to loathe her ways. She would go to crazy lengths to stay pure or clean like bathing everytime she went out as she was taught doing these things would please God. What was even more crazy was in her quest, she would abandon all common sense and humanity. Unfortunately for you, logic does little for these people. I hope you don't grow to resent your mother. She's been programmed this way and this will take a lot of time to erode her ways. \n \nYou're not impure. Some of our customs are absolutely mind numbing. Stay strong. Maybe talk to someone who's sensible in these matters and ask them to help. \n \nI totally slipped past that first day thing. Regarding the first day, talk to your dad. Do anything to get through to him - cry, faint, vomit. This is just crazy. Or you could openly defy your mother. It will be a pain. Start small. Eat something infront of her, drink a little water, go out of the room. It will be tough but it can't be tougher than it already is. Remember to start with something small, expect the unexpected, stay strong, have someone to call like a brother or bf who understands for moral support. "", ""Sweetie no. This is so wrong on so many levels. I can give you more info in private if you'd like to discuss.  \n\nWe had rules like these but I stopped following them years ago.  I got mine at 12. I'm 24 now. I don't even tell my mom I'm on my period these days because of all the rules. But listen. YOU ARE NOT IMPURE. The rules were put in place, where women were asked not to cook, because they'll be weaker. This was the real reason. \n\nOver generations people have perverted that and made it an impurity thing. There is nothing impure about it. It is clean blood same as a nose bleed. The only difference is where it comes from. In fact, the vaginal canal is self-cleaning. If anything, it's cleaner than a nose bleed. \n\nBefore I get downvoted by some childish immature men, I'd like to talk to you and give you some more tips on how to handle this. The food thing is just.... TERRIBLE. on my first day I want to lie in bed and scream and cry and eat all the junk food I can lay my hands on. "", ""No it doesn't make you impure! \n\nAs Indians, we are screwed up beings. \n\nIf a girl can't get pregnant, shame her.   \nIf a girl has periods, isolate her.   \nIf a girl gets mishandled, blame her.    \n\n"", 'First of all, **NO, you are not impure**. \n\nThere is no such thing as pure impure.

384,I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

Also, just remember that majority of Indian engineering institutions are filled with professors who have no idea about the industry.

Just my two cents."", ""You are an inspiration bro. Just one thing, don't wait for graduation to start earning money. Learn new things and start doing freelance work. When I was in college, the schedule seemed so hectic that I didn't find any time to do anything apart from study and a little sports. But now in job, I realize I had a lot of free time then and could really do better things than just wasting it on bakar. Do competitive programming, contribute in open source, pick relevant projects, maintain a good github profile and take up online courses on new technologies. You have a unique advantage of maturity that most of your batchmates don't. Perspective changes with age and there's more clarity on what to choose based on how much value it's gonna add. Use that advantage. You know there are millions of people who wish they could redo their college days with the same level of maturity and wisdom that they have now and you my friend are living their dream. So keep the motivation up and make the best out of these four years that you have."", ""That's such an inspiring journey .. imo opinion failures are necessary for success .. those who succeed without failure cannot grasp the true value of achievements"", ""Better late than never.

Good luck!!!', ""I wish there is someway I can reach out to you and hang out.     \n\nI am also from JU - I started my undergrad in a crappy engineering college at Bangalore. I loved Bangalore, loved Kannada people but hated engineering and the college. I grew up in Jodhpur Park - right next to Jadavpur University. I even had ice cream when the chemical engineering department used to make them as an experiment? I think it was the chem engg dept but I could be wrong. You were probably in first year when I was in PG1.   \n\nI did not face any of the adversities that you do - not even half of them. As I read your post, I realized how privileged a life I have had.    \n\nNone the less, dropped out of engineering - joined JU Arts. As much as people hate on JU arts - they are the most liberal people I have seen. There was a senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to JU arts and encourage them. Mind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now!   \n \nAnyways, JU arts turned it around for me. I did decently there, went onto get 2 masters and then finally into a PhD which I am hoping to graduate next year. I am 31 now and ironically I code for statistical analysis now. I had dropped out of CSE engineering and the only difference is I like what I do now.   \n\nThe moment I read JU, I hoped JU would be the turning point for you - just as it was for me. But we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take.   \n JU is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as a student is nothing but family.     \n\nDon't let people tell you what to do and how to do it. I have had really stupid people both in JU and mostly outside tell me that I would amount to nothing  - because I dropped out and because of my age. Bro, I started my PhD at 27 - two students I met in my cohort 1. An American African woman aged 41 2. A White gentleman aged 55 who had just retired from American Army. These two were older that most of the cohort which was by average 35 years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the PhD cohort. PhD cohort's have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go, especially the econometrics paper. While the lady was not that good at maths, she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper. They outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects. I ended up being really good friends with both of them. In fact they are the closest friends I have on campus. So no, age is honestly a number and nothing else - fight the good fight!  \n\n\nIf you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out - please reach out to me! This was actually my last summer break here in the country and I will be in Philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything I can help you with - please reach out! I am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country.   \n\nAnd again - fight the good fight, I am sure you will do great.   \nI leave you with a song that I used to listen to when I got depressed in JU about my career trajectory. The song was an anthem for us dropouts - Pulak da wrote the song. Pulak da was from Philosophy department and died in a road accident.

People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)


Thanks,


Failure at 25.

Edit 2: Thanks for the 2nd gold and 3rd silver. Much appreciated.


Edit 3: Thanks for the platinum!
I hope this post can give people a new direction and courage. Don't lose hope. You aren't alone.

Edit 4 : Thanks for the 4th silver. I have received a lot of messages with similar problems to mine and asking for guidance. If you are someone, who is reading this and you are stuck in a similar situation, feel free to message me for any queries/advice/motivation. ['More power to you bro. Wish you all the best!', '[deleted]', ""25 is still an early age. I've known a lot of people who went to college in their 30s and are doing quite well.\n\nJust make sure you use what you learn and build useful things."", ""Congrats on bouncing back! Also, just remember that majority of Indian engineering institutions are filled with professors who have no idea about the industry. Unless you're lucky, you'll mostly only end up with a useless degree at the end of 4 years. Just keep learning new things on the side and build a few pet projects for your resume. Just my two cents."", ""You are an inspiration bro. Just one thing, don't wait for graduation to start earning money. Learn new things and start doing freelance work. When I was in college, the schedule seemed so hectic that I didn't find any time to do anything apart from study and a little sports. But now in job, I realize I had a lot of free time then and could really do better things than just wasting it on bakar. Do competitive programming, contribute in open source, pick relevant projects, maintain a good github profile and take up online courses on new technologies. You have a unique advantage of maturity that most of your batchmates don't. Perspective changes with age and there's more clarity on what to choose based on how much value it's gonna add. Use that advantage. You know there are millions of people who wish they could redo their college days with the same level of maturity and wisdom that they have now and you my friend are living their dream. So keep the motivation up and make the best out of these four years that you have."", ""That's such an inspiring journey .. imo opinion failures are necessary for success .. those who succeed without failure cannot grasp the true value of achievements"", ""Better late than never. I was feeling quite anxious today about my career and I am just 21. Just graduated, dropped CA, picked up CFA. \nNow I've been applying for jobs and so far not much has happened. I was feeling defeated but I guess we only lose when we  stop trying. \nMore power to you, to me and everyone who needs. \n\nYou'll land on your feet because you are willing to work and that's what matters at the end of the day."", 'Fellow front-end dev here. Hit me up for any sort of help at any time!', 'Please get scientific paper published by the end of your [B.Tech](https://B.Tech). Contribute to open source projects. These are my suggestion. A good career awaits you. You shall be inspiration for others and me. Let me know If i can help you in any way. Good luck!!!', ""I wish there is someway I can reach out to you and hang out.     \n\nI am also from JU - I started my undergrad in a crappy engineering college at Bangalore. I loved Bangalore, loved Kannada people but hated engineering and the college. I grew up in Jodhpur Park - right next to Jadavpur University. I even had ice cream when the chemical engineering department used to make them as an experiment? I think it was the chem engg dept but I could be wrong. You were probably in first year when I was in PG1.   \n\nI did not face any of the adversities that you do - not even half of them. As I read your post, I realized how privileged a life I have had.    \n\nNone the less, dropped out of engineering - joined JU Arts. As much as people hate on JU arts - they are the most liberal people I have seen. There was a senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to JU arts and encourage them. Mind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now!   \n \nAnyways, JU arts turned it around for me. I did decently there, went onto get 2 masters and then finally into a PhD which I am hoping to graduate next year. I am 31 now and ironically I code for statistical analysis now. I had dropped out of CSE engineering and the only difference is I like what I do now.   \n\nThe moment I read JU, I hoped JU would be the turning point for you - just as it was for me. But we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take.   \n JU is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as a student is nothing but family.     \n\nDon't let people tell you what to do and how to do it. I have had really stupid people both in JU and mostly outside tell me that I would amount to nothing  - because I dropped out and because of my age. Bro, I started my PhD at 27 - two students I met in my cohort 1. An American African woman aged 41 2. A White gentleman aged 55 who had just retired from American Army. These two were older that most of the cohort which was by average 35 years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the PhD cohort. PhD cohort's have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go, especially the econometrics paper. While the lady was not that good at maths, she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper. They outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects. I ended up being really good friends with both of them. In fact they are the closest friends I have on campus. So no, age is honestly a number and nothing else - fight the good fight!  \n\n\nIf you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out - please reach out to me! This was actually my last summer break here in the country and I will be in Philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything I can help you with - please reach out! I am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country.   \n\nAnd again - fight the good fight, I am sure you will do great.   \nI leave you with a song that I used to listen to when I got depressed in JU about my career trajectory. The song was an anthem for us dropouts - Pulak da wrote the song. Pulak da was from Philosophy department and died in a road accident.

They are aggressive and charge thrice the original rate. \n\nDelhi ones are quite decent compared to these who sometimes try to charge 20-30 rupees extra. But yes that too is a big problem especially when the meter charges are revised recently. A few days back took an auto ride and he agreed to turn on the meter. While we reached the destination the charge was rounded off to 170 rs. I gave him 200 rs and he refused to give the balance. That really irked me and I got inside the auto and refused to leave. Then he started me turning in 10 rs each. I refused. I usually give extra ten-twenty if the driver is polite and turns on the meter but this kind of attitude is not tolerable.\n\nThe best auto drivers I have encountered are in Calicut, Kerala. They go by meter and insist to return any nominal balance. Even if it is 2-3 rs.

Ghataks from Dogra and Bihar opened up fire on the posts near 3 launching pads closer to the LOC (around 600m-1.2km in), the adjoining posts were destroyed rapidly :shoot:, this is where around 6-12 PA manning the posts were killed, Porkis only claim 2 PA killed, bet its 2 bodies they could recover, the rest would have been mulch.\nAfter turning the posts to rubble, Ghataks crossed over and destroyed the 3 launching pads where they killed smaller fidayeen squads of around 6 terrorists each. Ghataks went in loud, watching them close in with heavy fire at the 3rd launching pad, it appears one of the pigs blew himself up taking half his squad with him. :rofl:The death toll inflicted by the Ghataks is not clear because they used volleys from grenade launchers, RPO flame thrower, carl gustaf. A Ghatak got close enough to stab 2 bunched pigs with his bare hands.\n\nWhile the op was coming to a close, it appears a couple of truck loads of SSG BATs & Rangers were sent in for reinforcements but when they arrived and saw the volume of fire coming from the Ghataks, they got back in their trucks and ran. Ghataks then covered the Para's egress back.\n\nFinal, estimate of toll is between 60-70 killed including at least 6-12 PA.\n\nI am glad they decided to make it public.

Paras wasted them quietly, they didn't know what hit em, they wasted the sentries with silenced sniper shots and most were slaughtered in their sleep.. Ghataks from Dogra and Bihar opened up fire on the posts near 3 launching pads closer to the LOC (around 600m-1.2km in), the adjoining posts were destroyed rapidly :shoot:, this is where around 6-12 PA manning the posts were killed, Porkis only claim 2 PA killed, bet its 2 bodies they could recover, the rest would have been mulch.\nAfter turning the posts to rubble, Ghataks crossed over and destroyed the 3 launching pads where they killed smaller fidayeen squads of around 6 terrorists each. Ghataks went in loud, watching them close in with heavy fire at the 3rd launching pad, it appears one of the pigs blew himself up taking half his squad with him. :rofl:The death toll inflicted by the Ghataks is not clear because they used volleys from grenade launchers, RPO flame thrower, carl gustaf. A Ghatak got close enough to stab 2 bunched pigs with his bare hands.\n\nWhile the op was coming to a close, it appears a couple of truck loads of SSG BATs & Rangers were sent in for reinforcements but when they arrived and saw the volume of fire coming from the Ghataks, they got back in their trucks and ran. Ghataks then covered the Para's egress back.\n\nFinal, estimate of toll is between 60-70 killed including at least 6-12 PA.\n\nI am glad they decided to make it public. Paltan ki ijjat especially for Bihar and Dogra restored, they will however keep a low profile because there was nothing surgical about their role. Their role was much more akin to a hammer coming down hard. My family member says that the sheer speed and brute force of Ghataks in their role was some of the most beautiful IR drone footage caught in his recent memory. While the paras were surgical, they apparently looked so routine, like they had done it a thousands time before (and they have)."", 'Has such surgical strikes been carried out in the past or is this first? Any old articles or information... ', 'This is not a covert op. This is overt. Reason for doing for overt act maybe because India feels confident that the action can be defended diplomatically with other countries (obviously excluding Pakistan) and that the other countries (USA, Russia, EU etc) might condemn it but not impose any penalties.\n\nSimilar action is frequently taken by Israel as a reaction to attacks on its territory.', 'this made it to r/all in 2 hrs', 'I think the dice has been rolled.

You can see what we are doing if you look up COVID Homebrew Mask Relief on Facebook groups. We're actually working on a trully global scale in that group since we have people from all over the world. Ideally each unit would be powered by sustainable/ renewable energy. Each unit would also have food production capacity as well. So if for example someone needs some spinach for example. They could see if it was available on the matter hackers network nearby. \\n\\nI personally think humanity deserves a UBI however until that's politically possible I want to utilize networks so that we can all create a web of support for each other. The network could use a certain percent of income to purchase the needed equipment to expand the network so for example eventually you wouldn't need to buy a 3d printer or other equipment it would be provided for you.

It happens that when you’re young, everyone your age almost shuns family in favour for coworkers, friends and acquaintances. This is short lived. Later on, all these people will become too busy with their own personal lives, and they won’t reach out to you for an emotional connection or friendship.

With every step you take in life you get to grow more as a person. Getting married, having kids, they all change you and that’s how you mature in different ways. If you don’t do this, you risk becoming an old person who can’t connect with the other old people around because they’ve all been through stuff that you haven’t been through and it’s too late. Secondly, with age, your social life becomes your family, pretty much exclusively. It happens that when you’re young, everyone your age almost shuns family in favour for coworkers, friends and acquaintances. This is short lived. Later on, all these people will become too busy with their own personal lives, and they won’t reach out to you for an emotional connection or friendship. Not because they don’t want to, but because they slowly get sucked into their own growing family and it’s occupying all their time and emotional energy, which also ends up becoming their main source of satisfaction too. \\n\\nLastly, it’s one thing ending up by yourself and unmarried during old age because of circumstances beyond your control, and another thing ending up like this out of your own choice. The feeling of having missed out will be strong if it was all your decision. \\n\\nBut, all in all, life has taught me that we are all so very different and it is very true that one man’s vision can be the opposite of another.

I was taught that in Islam, lifting the bier (kaandha dena) is considered a very spiritual and respectful act, so much so that in some burials and janazahs you can find literal strangers scrambling to carry the bier of any passing-by Muslim's body even for just a couple of seconds. I remember my mother insisting on me to support the bier of any death ritual we go to. You'll also notice in the video how people are rushing to carry the bier, and how folks keep circulating their positions by giving everyone a chance. I haven't verified this news, but I'm assuming some Mulsims couldn't bear the disrespect of nobody giving shoulder to their dead neighbour which is why they may have done this.\", 'This should be brought to attention of main media channels and shown on tv.', 'Such a welcome video (except the man dying part) in these days of doom and gloom.', 'The media will never show this.

There is a reason that others did not come out.\", 'Mera India! ❤️', 'Dead body can still spread virus right ?', '[removed]', \"It is not something that should be appreciated. Infact I think it was a pretty foolish move. There was a reason why his bier was not lifted by his relatives. At this moment where we have thousands of cases coming up everyday, it seems like the best move although it sounds harsh. I don't understand how people are not understanding the importance of social distancing.\", 'In the event of actual covid deaths, it should be handled by government. Burial done by people with protective equipment and lime.', 'I love every bit of this', \"The same thing I was discussing with my wife the other day. In UK unconfirmed reports say that the Gov is deciding on mass cremation irrespective of religious rights to a burial or a cremation. Apparently in  Italy they are doing mass cremations as people are not readily available to carry out these duties. I reminded her that for muslims it's the religious duty to partake in funerals and they would do that if they were allowed in the lockdown. It may well be the same people they harbour extreme hate against end up performing their last rites.\", 'It’s sad to see someone so dear die, during this pandemic irrespective of whether the person died of Corona or not. Great gesture by the Neighbours by respecting humanity over religion. Now this may come off as rude and extremely insensitive, but the relatives not coming to lift the bier is just following the lockdown protocol. At this stage of the pandemic, you don’t want more people to contract COVID-19 or worse succumb to it. Countries have started to ban funerals , don’t know if India is one of them, but I highly think that they should be banned here in India too. Don’t know the solution to this sensitive issue but cremation of the dead (preferably as per their religious beliefs) should be added in the essential services (it probably is part of it) but WITH the facility of taking away the body from the house/hospital, so that it avoids crowds like these at a funeral. The traditions like ‘kandhaa dena’ bring a lot of risk of people coming into groups and should be banned. The tradition that the cremation service could follow is cremating them as per their religious beliefs with least possible or perhaps even no family members. I know this sounds very very insensitive but I think looking at the gravity of the situation, such severe protocol implementations are needed. Maybe this service could act as an employment opportunity for some people who aren’t been provided with relief funds amidst this crisis too. If I am not wrong, the bodies of the patients who died to COVID-19 aren’t being returned to the family as well, which again sounds insensitive but is necessary.', \"Majority of Muslims & 'non-Sanghi' Hindus: *Be kind and just to everyone..

I'm looking at creating a distributed manufacturing, power generation, and transportation network in the U.S. The idea is to have people making parts of something. Those parts are transported via drone to another local finishing / assembly plant which is then delivered via drone to the final customer. \\n\\nYou wouldn't have to build everything at once for this to work. You could for example create a network of local people who have access to or can make 3d printers. Then each of the people who have a printer can then accept jobs from the matter hackers network, and then print them within a certain time frame. The parts could be delivered via traditional mail even. \\n\\nI'm really sorry for what's happening to you. I really hope you find something, and probably most of what you find will be easier and more realistic then what I'm proposing. However if we do get a global matter hackers network going it could provide financial stability for so many.\\n\\nRight now the group I started on Facebook is purely focused on using 3d printers, laser cutters, or just by handiwork i.e. cloth masks to produce PPE for healthcare providers, and our communities in general. You can see what we are doing if you look up COVID Homebrew Mask Relief on Facebook groups. We're actually working on a trully global scale in that group since we have people from all over the world. Ideally each unit would be powered by sustainable/ renewable energy. Each unit would also have food production capacity as well. So if for example someone needs some spinach for example. They could see if it was available on the matter hackers network nearby. \\n\\nI personally think humanity deserves a UBI however until that's politically possible I want to utilize networks so that we can all create a web of support for each other. The network could use a certain percent of income to purchase the needed equipment to expand the network so for example eventually you wouldn't need to buy a 3d printer or other equipment it would be provided for you. You would also have to make people use proper ventilation and sequestration techniques while they are printing. The last thing I would want to see is people getting cancer for example due to the fumes.\\n\\nAgain best of luck and thanks for reading this wall of text.\", \"Can we start a crowdfund to fund you for once?

I was taught that in Islam, lifting the bier (kaandha dena) is considered a very spiritual and respectful act, so much so that in some burials and janazahs you can find literal strangers scrambling to carry the bier of any passing-by Muslim's body even for just a couple of seconds. I remember my mother insisting on me to support the bier of any death ritual we go to. You'll also notice in the video how people are rushing to carry the bier, and how folks keep circulating their positions by giving everyone a chance. I haven't verified this news, but I'm assuming some Mulsims couldn't bear the disrespect of nobody giving shoulder to their dead neighbour which is why they may have done this.\", 'This should be brought to attention of main media channels and shown on tv.', 'Such a welcome video (except the man dying part) in these days of doom and gloom.', 'The media will never show this.

Infact I think it was a pretty foolish move. There was a reason why his bier was not lifted by his relatives. At this moment where we have thousands of cases coming up everyday, it seems like the best move although it sounds harsh. I don't understand how people are not understanding the importance of social distancing.\", 'In the event of actual covid deaths, it should be handled by government. Burial done by people with protective equipment and lime.', 'I love every bit of this', \"The same thing I was discussing with my wife the other day. In UK unconfirmed reports say that the Gov is deciding on mass cremation irrespective of religious rights to a burial or a cremation. Apparently in  Italy they are doing mass cremations as people are not readily available to carry out these duties. I reminded her that for muslims it's the religious duty to partake in funerals and they would do that if they were allowed in the lockdown. It may well be the same people they harbour extreme hate against end up performing their last rites.\", 'It’s sad to see someone so dear die, during this pandemic irrespective of whether the person died of Corona or not. Great gesture by the Neighbours by respecting humanity over religion. Now this may come off as rude and extremely insensitive, but the relatives not coming to lift the bier is just following the lockdown protocol. At this stage of the pandemic, you don’t want more people to contract COVID-19 or worse succumb to it. Countries have started to ban funerals , don’t know if India is one of them, but I highly think that they should be banned here in India too. Don’t know the solution to this sensitive issue but cremation of the dead (preferably as per their religious beliefs) should be added in the essential services (it probably is part of it) but WITH the facility of taking away the body from the house/hospital, so that it avoids crowds like these at a funeral. The traditions like ‘kandhaa dena’ bring a lot of risk of people coming into groups and should be banned. The tradition that the cremation service could follow is cremating them as per their religious beliefs with least possible or perhaps even no family members. I know this sounds very very insensitive but I think looking at the gravity of the situation, such severe protocol implementations are needed. Maybe this service could act as an employment opportunity for some people who aren’t been provided with relief funds amidst this crisis too. If I am not wrong, the bodies of the patients who died to COVID-19 aren’t being returned to the family as well, which again sounds insensitive but is necessary.', \"Majority of Muslims & 'non-Sanghi' Hindus: *Be kind and just to everyone..

I was taught that in Islam, lifting the bier (kaandha dena) is considered a very spiritual and respectful act, so much so that in some burials and janazahs you can find literal strangers scrambling to carry the bier of any passing-by Muslim's body even for just a couple of seconds. I remember my mother insisting on me to support the bier of any death ritual we go to. You'll also notice in the video how people are rushing to carry the bier, and how folks keep circulating their positions by giving everyone a chance. I haven't verified this news, but I'm assuming some Mulsims couldn't bear the disrespect of nobody giving shoulder to their dead neighbour which is why they may have done this.\", 'This should be brought to attention of main media channels and shown on tv.', 'Such a welcome video (except the man dying part) in these days of doom and gloom.', 'The media will never show this.

Infact I think it was a pretty foolish move. There was a reason why his bier was not lifted by his relatives. At this moment where we have thousands of cases coming up everyday, it seems like the best move although it sounds harsh. I don't understand how people are not understanding the importance of social distancing.\", 'In the event of actual covid deaths, it should be handled by government. Burial done by people with protective equipment and lime.', 'I love every bit of this', \"The same thing I was discussing with my wife the other day. In UK unconfirmed reports say that the Gov is deciding on mass cremation irrespective of religious rights to a burial or a cremation. Apparently in  Italy they are doing mass cremations as people are not readily available to carry out these duties. I reminded her that for muslims it's the religious duty to partake in funerals and they would do that if they were allowed in the lockdown. It may well be the same people they harbour extreme hate against end up performing their last rites.\", 'It’s sad to see someone so dear die, during this pandemic irrespective of whether the person died of Corona or not. Great gesture by the Neighbours by respecting humanity over religion. Now this may come off as rude and extremely insensitive, but the relatives not coming to lift the bier is just following the lockdown protocol. At this stage of the pandemic, you don’t want more people to contract COVID-19 or worse succumb to it. Countries have started to ban funerals , don’t know if India is one of them, but I highly think that they should be banned here in India too. Don’t know the solution to this sensitive issue but cremation of the dead (preferably as per their religious beliefs) should be added in the essential services (it probably is part of it) but WITH the facility of taking away the body from the house/hospital, so that it avoids crowds like these at a funeral. The traditions like ‘kandhaa dena’ bring a lot of risk of people coming into groups and should be banned. The tradition that the cremation service could follow is cremating them as per their religious beliefs with least possible or perhaps even no family members. I know this sounds very very insensitive but I think looking at the gravity of the situation, such severe protocol implementations are needed. Maybe this service could act as an employment opportunity for some people who aren’t been provided with relief funds amidst this crisis too. If I am not wrong, the bodies of the patients who died to COVID-19 aren’t being returned to the family as well, which again sounds insensitive but is necessary.', \"Majority of Muslims & 'non-Sanghi' Hindus: *Be kind and just to everyone..

I was taught that in Islam, lifting the bier (kaandha dena) is considered a very spiritual and respectful act, so much so that in some burials and janazahs you can find literal strangers scrambling to carry the bier of any passing-by Muslim's body even for just a couple of seconds. I remember my mother insisting on me to support the bier of any death ritual we go to. You'll also notice in the video how people are rushing to carry the bier, and how folks keep circulating their positions by giving everyone a chance. I haven't verified this news, but I'm assuming some Mulsims couldn't bear the disrespect of nobody giving shoulder to their dead neighbour which is why they may have done this.\", 'This should be brought to attention of main media channels and shown on tv.', 'Such a welcome video (except the man dying part) in these days of doom and gloom.', 'The media will never show this.

In UK unconfirmed reports say that the Gov is deciding on mass cremation irrespective of religious rights to a burial or a cremation. Apparently in  Italy they are doing mass cremations as people are not readily available to carry out these duties. I reminded her that for muslims it's the religious duty to partake in funerals and they would do that if they were allowed in the lockdown. It may well be the same people they harbour extreme hate against end up performing their last rites.\", 'It’s sad to see someone so dear die, during this pandemic irrespective of whether the person died of Corona or not. Great gesture by the Neighbours by respecting humanity over religion. Now this may come off as rude and extremely insensitive, but the relatives not coming to lift the bier is just following the lockdown protocol. At this stage of the pandemic, you don’t want more people to contract COVID-19 or worse succumb to it. Countries have started to ban funerals , don’t know if India is one of them, but I highly think that they should be banned here in India too. Don’t know the solution to this sensitive issue but cremation of the dead (preferably as per their religious beliefs) should be added in the essential services (it probably is part of it) but WITH the facility of taking away the body from the house/hospital, so that it avoids crowds like these at a funeral. The traditions like ‘kandhaa dena’ bring a lot of risk of people coming into groups and should be banned. The tradition that the cremation service could follow is cremating them as per their religious beliefs with least possible or perhaps even no family members. I know this sounds very very insensitive but I think looking at the gravity of the situation, such severe protocol implementations are needed. Maybe this service could act as an employment opportunity for some people who aren’t been provided with relief funds amidst this crisis too. If I am not wrong, the bodies of the patients who died to COVID-19 aren’t being returned to the family as well, which again sounds insensitive but is necessary.', \"Majority of Muslims & 'non-Sanghi' Hindus: *Be kind and just to everyone..

Sure, between the two - a choice that will never be given to anyone in practice - the kerala model is better for overall betterment of the society.\n\nBut in practice, the Kerala model evolved thanks to a lot of factors: Social movements against caste and for equality, enlightened kings, international sea trade, little interference by the British, lack of invasions like in North, missionaries with their focus on education, competition by the kings and other religions in education as well as healthcare... All of which led to a strong awareness of rights learned from the Left which even influenced the Congress, a good dose of capitalism when it comes to investment in education and healthcare, the opening of the Gulf and later other countries to skilled and unskilled malayalees who send money back and so on. Land reforms were another.\n\nIt also has its negatives when it comes to the left's inability to be a constructive opposition, too many strikes and hartals, and an earlier strong opposition to capitalism which they have mostly abandoned.\n\nGujarat does not have any of those advantages but what it has is a good number of highly entrepreneurial people (who have over time because very strongly communal), a huge tribal population that has not benefited and which proponents of the Gujarat model actively try to ignore or downplay...\n\nMost states of India are not in a position to adopt either model.

However, the lack of deliberate social reform movements still has a strong impact, which is easily visible among a minority of the population as strong hostility to other communities, hostility to tourism, to any outsiders and despite the comfort with western attire and skin show, an inability to think of people unlike them as their equals.

So I live in Ghaziabad (Delhi NCR basically) and I am now passed out from this school. I went to buy some stuff a hour earlier and these dogs attacked me. As I am good with dogs I was able to save myself. But it reminded me of something that happened in our school 3 years ago. And it really makes my blood boil that the situation isn't any better. These dogs have been a nuisance for a long time. And before I get hate I want to tell you I am a huge dog lover and I was used to feed strays all the time in my ex society. Just think how these kids must be feeling going to school everyday with a disfigured face which was no fault of theirs. Their poor parents complained to the municipality office but they didn't do shit. Some of us can deal with dogs but just think of a kid or your little brother. His first reflex would be to run and God knows what he can do. My neighbour comes home late from work every night and he is always feels threatened that one day a dog may bite him and this is the problem with India as a whole we just wait for something bad to happen before taking any action. Its pretty frustrating to not be able to go for a morning walk without feeling safe.

And politicians like Maneka Gandhi who probably have never stepped out of her car doesn't know what problem these dogs pose to two wheeler owners and pedestrians. 

I also understand that I can't demonize all stray dogs because some stray dogs are aggressive but do you have a better solution. And look I am a leftist humanist and whatever so I do believe in equality but equality is a vague term. Equality means equality of equals you can't go and ask for reservations that SC/ST gets on the argument that you both are human and equal. So don't give me shit like dogs are equal and tbfh they are not I do agree that they have the right to coexist with us in this planet but humans are the priority and there is no denying that. If you think dog life equal human life you should probably wake from your damn utopia. People like this piss me the most saying ""oh but you can't do that if a human kills or rapes someone you can't wipe of humanity"" but you sure can wipe out that human. In simple words stray dogs are pests that threaten humans and should be dealt with the most humane way possible I also don't support mass killing but people who think there is no problem I hope you get fucking biten.

I think people should report aggressive dogs and they should be killed without any protests through injections.
All females need to be sterilized and all dogs should get vaccinated and stuff so we can decrease chance of rabies.
As population goes down shelters should be built to keep them in the shelters and awareness should be spread that how low maintenance they are and they make a great pet (which is true my dad had one).",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g6ndo7/indias_stray_dog_problem/,"[""The entire problem is created by Maneka Gandhi and until people start reporting this more, and create a big issue over this, it'll not get solved.

58,Politics,g6md1z,Geopolitics of Bangladesh liberation war - Why India initially didn't want East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh) to gain independence from West Pakistan (modern day Pakistan ),"I was researching on this subject recently which revealed some interesting points about the Bangladesh liberation war and the indo Pakistan 1971 war

**1) Indira Gandhi government was of opinion that east Bangladeshi parties coming to power in combined Pakistan assembly would moderate west Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir**

So , I need to give a little background . Before the Bangladesh liberation war really gathered steam , a student protest had already broken our in West and east Pakistan against dictator Ayub Khan . The movement demanded the restoration of democracy in combined Pakistan . When the situation became too hot to handle , the Pakistani military stepped in and deposed Ayub khan . It was decided to hold elections soon .

Now , you need to know that population wise , the population of Bangladeshis in east Pakistan was numerically greater than population of West Pakistan . 

In the elections that followed that , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his party Awami league won a landslide victory in East Pakistan . They won almost every seat in East Pakistan (awami league lost only 2 seats ) and emerged as the single largest party in combined Pakistan national assembly.Bhutto and his People's party were the second largest but nowhere near majority.

This was a shock election results for the Pakistani military establishment and Bhutto who had thought that west Pakistani dominance in national assembly was inevitable.

The Indian government found this result as optimistic for India . We thought that the Bengali politicians of East Pakistan would care less about Kashmir and would start an era of better relationship with India . Thus as a result , in the initial days of the liberation movement , India wasn't really keen on an independent Bangladesh as that would mean an even more rabid west Pakistan with regards to Kashmir 

**2) Indira Gandhi government was afraid of leftist elements in Bangladeshi independence movement . She was afraid that once they attain independence , they will give support to the Maoist - naxal insurgency raging in West Bengal**

The cold war geopolitics had caused Pakistan to join the side of capitalist America and the west . 

Meanwhile in India , a Maoist insurgency was raging in West Bengal and East India .

Indira Gandhi and her government was afraid that once Bangaldesh attained independence , the left elements involved in the liberation movement would give refuge and support to the Maoist insurgents in West Bengal ( which was not currently happening since Pakistan was on the American side )

As a result , members of Indira Gandhi government were of opinion that it was better if east Pakistan remained part of Pakistan 

**3) Soviet Union was afraid that an independent Bangladesh would be a Chinese ally**

Before the liberation movement , the sino-soviet split had taken place . The communist world was taking the side of either China or Soviet Union .

Soviet Union was afraid that the Maoist section of the Bangaldesh liberation movement would push them towards the China camp .

As a result , Soviet Union warned India against any drastic action in Bangladesh .

They kept this position until Indira Gandhi herself went to Moscow and held a 5 hour meeting with the top leader to brief them on the ongoing genocide in East Pakistan (operation searchlight ) . She also reminded them of their obligation under Indo-Soviet friendship treaty . It was after this meeting that Soviet Union finally changed their position and sided with India 

**4) America was afraid that break up of Pakistan would derail the ongoing negotiations between China - USA which was being done via Pakistan . As a result Nixon threatened India that any war against Pakistan will be expensive for India**

The green Revolution hadn't taken place yet . India had a ship to mouth existence where American aid to poor countries like India kept us afloat . America used to send food package and other relief measures to India regularly . 

If America had suspended those relief packages and placed sanctions on us , we would have been in great trouble . On top of those  , if they had placed more sanctions on us , our economic system would have collapsed .

I've tried a variation of most of the options here, the best thing that worked out for me is to just use the official documentation for whatever language / tool that you want to learn and see what they recommend an example is if you want to learn vue js then just study their entire documentation and try out all the examples and then try a sample project that you've wanted to do, if you don't know what project you want to implement them search for good project ideas online on medium or GitHub or reddit or wherever, some tech like android have their own offical course by googlers themselves and from what I remember they really were good so it really depends on each of the tech but the official one is the best, there might be some cases where the official documentation sucks in which case you have to start thinking if whether the language/tool/tech you are learning really is a good one because usually most good tech has good documentation and a lot of people contributing to it except in really really rare cases.\n\nOnce you know the language the next thing you would probably want to do is how to write the code in a neater way, I personally would recommend books on writing clean code (Clean Code is a personal favourite of mine) and then read books on design patterns (take this in slowly because I ended up reading them too quickly the first time without even understanding this properly and fucked up my code big time on a project and I'm still paying for the flaws I've made) and watch videos of the conferences that these tech holds, it helps you be updated and see what the top guys of these tech are upto and what they recommend.\n\nAs for competitive programming, it really depends on what your end goal is, I usually get this occasional itch where I don't want to develop something but I just want to program during these times I just log onto a competitive programming site and then just pick a random problem and then try to solve it and end up learning a data structure or algorithm technique, if you want to get good at this then many of the competitive programming websites have a lot of tutorials and stuff I would recommend the book (How to solve it by computing) as a fairly simpler introduction to competitive programming and algorithms if the resources online are overwhelming. Some good competitive programming websites would be topcoder, codeforces (where the really top and over enthusiastic guys hang around) these people are really hardcore and solve a lot of problems and they have an excellent problem set for you to solve it, then we have hackerrank and codechef which attracts a lot of Indian crown so if you want to talk to people from your own country for some reason you could try here, there are other lesser known ones you could try atcoder, project Euler, spoj etc which you can check out, I would recommend selecting the websites that you like and then going from there but unless your job is going to be heavily dependent on data structures or algorithm level problems I'm not too sure if they would be useful in your day to day job (they help you get through your interviews easily though) but it's still fun to learn."", ""(1) Java - as part of my internship\n      Python - hobby projects\n      C and C++ - college projects\n(2) (a) youtube definitely helped.

As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.   


**Background on AFRS**

The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:  


1. Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs,
2. Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),
3. Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA ,
4. Women and Child Development Ministry's KhoyaPaya Portal,
5. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA
6. Any other image database available with police/other entities.  


The NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/)).  However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB.  According to an [**update**](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender/AFRS.pdf) dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.  


As pointed out in our previous [**blogpost**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/) on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected. Proportionality during processing of personal data means that only that personal data which is adequate and relevant for the purposes of the processing is collected and processed.   


**Steps taken by IFF**  


IFF has sought a [**three year moratorium**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-the-government-seeking-a-3-year-moratorium-on-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-india-projectpanoptic/) to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a [**legal notice**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/) to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.

In this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:  


1. NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System.
2. The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology
3. The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems.
4. The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.  


**What’s Next?**

IFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.

119,AskIndia,g6jggc,How does herd immunity work?,"Does herd immunity mean that if half the population gets infected, the other half automatically becomes immune?
I am confused.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g6jggc/how_does_herd_immunity_work/,"['https://youtu.be/tC47JjakPSA. This video explains it in 1 minute with animation.', 'Trying my best bit to make sense of what I read some time back. \n\nBefore you start with herd immunity you need to understand two things. Herd Threshold and R.zero factor.\n\nProportion of immune individuals in a sample set of population above which the disease cannot spread. This is defined as ""Herd Threshold"". Herd Threshold is dependent on the size of the population. Greater the population sample greater the number. \n\n""R.zero"" typical number of infections passed on by an infectious person. A measure of person to person transmission within herd/community.\n\nWhen a person or a group of persons are part of an immune herd then the probability of spread depends on the Herd Threshold and the R.zero factor. Chances of an infection spread decrease within a community with larger density of immune people. This can protect those without immunity. People who are affected with the infection will be acting as barriers to spreaders. They may carry but won\'t spread.  In disease elimination this can be achieved to eradicate the infection within the community if appropriate or slightly higher than required threshold can be reached.', 'Herd Immunity is a phenomena seen when a high percentage of individuals within a population have developed immunity to a pathogen. Because so many people within the community are unable to contract the disease or virus, this reduces the likelihood that those who have not developed immunity will contract the disease. \n\nELI5 - Imagine there is a nasty virus going around infecting people but 95% of the population is immune.\nThat means there is a 95% chance of the virus dying and just 5% chance of it infecting someone in the community. As opposed to an 100% infection rate if there is no immunity at all.', '\\>Does herd immunity mean that if half the population gets infected, the other half automatically becomes immune? I am confused\n\nNo. That isnt it. \n\nThink of something contagious- say disease. It can only spread from one person(A) to another(B), if the second person has never gotten the disease. If the second person has had the disease, her own immune system will attack the disease and s/he will ok. \n\nSo assume a room has a population of 26 and only A is infected. The scenarios:\n\n1. The room has no immunity: A meets B, C, D, E - B,C,D,E fall sick, and they introduce it to the others.. quickly the whole room is sick. \n2. In the room 50% have had the disease before and will not be sick. A meets B, C, D, E, but B, D are immune, so only C & E fall sick, and the 50% of the room that was not immune gets sick (but slower than in 1)\n3. Assume 90% of the room is immune.  In other words, out of A-Z, only 3 are not immune. Lets assume these three are G, N,  and U. \n\nIf A meets B,C,D,E - no one falls sick. A falls   \n sick, gets better, but does not infect anyone else.  (So G, N, U are safe). \n\nEven if A meets B,C,D,E,F,G - only G falls sick - and the virus can only survive if G meets N or U. Else A & G both are now sick and slowly get better without infecting others. \n\nBasically in other words, herd immunity reduces the chances of a disease moving from person to person and reaching you. \n\n\\-------------------------------------\n\nAnother concept that does matter is viral load. \n\nViral load is the amount of virus needed to infect you. So hypothetically, 10-50 virus particles does not make you sick, 50 virus particles makes you sick and 100 virus particles makes you very sick. \n\nIn a population of immune people, the viral load you get is reduced. So instead of getting 50 virus particles after meeting 5 people, you may get only 15 virus particles when you are in community with herd immunity. So to fall sick, you need to meet 15 people to fall sick.  \n\nSo when there is herd immunity, the sickness is not as bad. Instead of falling very very sick and being admitted to the ICU, you will just fall sick and get better.', 'Here come the internet scientists', 'What it basically means is given sufficient time, only fit will survive.']",0,-1

open football league, open T20 tournaments, MMA, triatholons etc.

I want the competition to be TRULY open. Just like how standing for elections is open. (that analogy work?)

Maybe badminton and maybe tennis and golf is called open but still wants you to be registered with a club and there are other rules that I feel doesn't make it open for all citizens.

(Here only talking about outdoor games, and boxing-ring type games. So chess and sudoko and that stuff doesn't count, even though they're equally hard.)

There will be a huge entry fee, BUT NO CATCH. We just keep adding ideas whenever we come across a problem. I don't think fees will grow unreasonably high but we can find something for that too, like crowdfunding or subsidies, and maybe the state can direct its propaganda machine into something like this. If people start getting more into it, this can become a good national revenue, just like alcohol for UP.

Anybody who is willing to pay is welcome to try. No need to be linked to a club or an institution.

Need 11 players? just bring your eleven friends, pay for each member and try to win.

Don't need proof of experience. No upper age limit. No cv or passport photo of gazetted officer.

No require degree. No black belt. No 20-20 vision.

If you are at least normal enough person that thinks you have what it takes to win and wants to compete, and you can afford the fees, then you are eligible.

Just pay the money, and you get one chance. You lose you're out. You win, you climb to next level, glory awaits you.

In my brain I imagine this turning into a shaolin soccer-like event.

Maybe you think, nobody wants to watch unknown people compete in a national contest. But you know ... have faith.

> Netflix has unlocked a selection of educational documentary films and series — available now for free on YouTube — saying it’s a way to help teachers and students during the COVID-19 quarantine.

> “Period. End of Sentence.” (Short Film): Director Rayka Zehtabchi tells the story of women in a rural village outside Delhi, India, who learn to manufacture and market their own sanitary pads.

About the film: https://www.news18.com/news/movies/period-end-of-sentence-review-this-netflix-documentary-is-aspirational-in-principle-impactful-in-general-2034769.html

> Rayka Zehtabchi’s short directorial is aimed at unwrapping stigma, fear, insecurity, ignorance and bad education, inherent in a woman’s life. Her tool--a humble looking sanitary pad. The film opens inside a room, two girls in their adolescent years, shying away when asked to talk about menstruation. 

> As is revealed, we all know of it but we don’t talk about it. “Menstruation is the biggest taboo in India”, points out Arunachalam Murauganantham, the social activist from Coimbatore, who is leading the crusade of making India into a 100 per cent sanitary napkin using country.

> We meet characters that champion the filmmaker’s cause. We are introduced to Sneha, Rekha, Shabana and other unnamed heroes of the film that are entrepreneurial, self-sufficient, smart and empathetic. Here, they are not dealing with issues limited only to their village, but are shouting out at the ones that are much bigger than them.

137,Politics,g6o9rw,Is democracy right for India?,"This is just meant to be a ""what-if"" post and nothing to be taken serious. This is to promote a healthy debate.
I in no way support dictatorship, authoritarianism or anything like that. I am very proud of our democratic traditions however flawed they might be, you can't deny they have held well since independence and I hope they stay strong forever. This can be said to be a case study.

So Iets start with China which have a single party authoritative form of government. And if you compare our economies till 1980 things were pretty similar. Similar populations, similar gdp, similar poverty levels etc. But in just 30 years China have literally left us in the dust in matters of economy and there is no denying that. Now, I do think we have done pretty well ourselves but it's not enough considering our huge population. The thing is whatever you say about the lack of freedom in China etc etc. There government get things done. For eg. How they cleaned up Beijing's pollution problem with a good laid out effective plan. That's a huge flaw of democracy. The time it takes to reach a conclusion is often devastatingly slow. Now, ofcourse I think democracy is the better form of government as people get to participate in the decision making process. But here stems the first question,
 
Do you think it's good for a country LIKE India?
Once you reach a certain level of development I think democracy is a better choice but do you think for a country like India or a  third world country, a country that is just corrupt and have many problems. Will democracy be a good choice. I mean I can't name many third world countries that became developed following democratic principles (The West is definitely not developed due to democracy. Yeah colonialism I am looking at you.) I think you need a government which can make decisions quick and effectively. Now the whole problem with this is that if we give power to a single party or person no one gets to question them and they can abuse their power for their own benefit. So it can go two ways, Either you get someone like Mao Zedong (Who is a fucking moron) or a Deng Xiaoping (Who is a fucking legend. Literally pulled China out of the junk.) So the second question is,

If you get a smart dictator (like Deng Xiaoping) will you prefer an authoritarian government?
Now with all this will definitely come a problem of shutting a few mouths and stuff as there will always be opposition to change. So some civil liberties will be naturally be curbed in a government of this type. So the third question is, 

Will you be willing to trade your civil liberties with a guarantee that the regime will make the country developed?

We can see examples of this in the Four Asian Tigers. Let's restrict it to South Korea and Singapore. Singapore had a great dictator in Lee Kuan. He changed a small country's destiny in a few decades. (Deng Xiaoping proved it can be done on a larger scale as well). And then you look at South Asia which isn't doing great at all! We have Sri Lanka with their civil war. Pakistan with their Coup. Nepal which isn't doing well and Bangladesh isn't doing well either. Also South Korea later turned to a democracy and I think they are doing great. So the last question is,

Will you accept an authoritarian government if it will turn to a democracy later when things settle down?
(Though this is rare)

So tell me what you think guys! I just want India to be a country that the world appreciate. Because undoubtedly there is no country in the world that will be as great as India once it is a developed country.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g6o9rw/is_democracy_right_for_india/,"[""What's the point if the world starts appreciating us but we lose all our freedoms?"", ""No other way to keep so many ethnicities, religions and class groups working together, I'm afraid.\n\nAnd no way of ensuring that the Indian Mao doesn't kill us all."", 'WE  👏 NEED 👏 EDUCATIONAL 👏 REFORMS 👏 PERIOD.', 'Argh, we can also be Europe or Canada.', 'Democracy may not be right for India but why do you expect that a totalitarian leader or a dictator will be on your side.

138,AskIndia,g6omqh,Why some girls keep guys hanging?,"So there's this girl friend I had crush upon. When I expressed my feelings and asked her out around 10 months ago, she rejected it. I respected her decision and accepted it but it took me a while to let go all the feelings and recover from that. We stayed as friends even after that, sometimes indulging in flirting (mostly her, mine is just as a response). But since last few weeks, I am feeling she's flirting much more and showing attitude at the same time. And this has brought back all the bittersweet memories and left me confused how to read it! 


Can't share/explain more things on here!

1. Why some girls keep guys hanging? Have you or someone you know experienced this?


2. Have you expressed your feelings to a girl for a second time after getting rejected fitst time?

But the main problem is of antibody test kits which we have to import from other countries.

Now,
Why India is not able to get sufficient antibody kits ,is it due to shortage of funds ,less seriousness of this pandemic or some other reason.

Except Kolkata ofcourse cuz of the point 1. \n\n\nOverall the govt doesn't have enough kits to begin with as it is. I don't know what exactly happened with MyLab since we haven't heard from them since their initial declaration/announcement.

161,Non-Political,g5w2c7,Self-loathing,"I'm a young guy born to a typical Indian middle class family. Most of my relatives conflate psychiatry with sorcery. Their thoughts sometimes are repulsive. I've for a while now suffered from self-loathing. This detestation of who I am manifests in my actions.

 I'll sacrifice my desires to please others because there's an ingrained feeling that I'm worthless. It's this irrepressible desire to appease others. That craving for approval maddens me.

I find no joy in my achievements because I tend to compare myself with others. It's indubitable that there'll always be people more successful than us. Intellectually I understand it but unable to internalise it. My acquaintances encourage me to utter affirmations. But they've been sterile. Utterly ineffective.


My passive-aggression repels me. Until not too long ago I wasn't aware of my tendencies. A good samaritan sat me down and elucidated what I was suffering from. I started dispassionately observing my behaviour and I've sensed a pit in my stomach when I don't receive the approval I crave.
I'm encouraged to love myself. But it's a cryptic expression. I've watched countless videos by these soi-disant motivators. The more I watch them the more I hate myself. I've been encouraged to visit mental health professionals. But I cannot at this stage.


I've poured my heart out. More often than not I utter what others want to hear. It's clear why I'd do that. That ephemeral thrill that I've been approved drives me to do that.

Stop worrying about the future and concentrate on the present. Don\'t forget to enjoy this time as well or else you will only regret later on.\n\nAnother thing that really irks me is that people talk about engineering and ias as though they are part of the same career path. Let me clarify something, ias and engineering are completely different! I still remember that when I had finally got admission into a great college after dropping a year, my uncle had said,""Great!

Regret about not getting into an IIT lasts for 8 years but regret about wasting your youth and going into the wrong field lasts for a lifetime.', 'As a student who tried both exams and failed, I think I am better placed to answer this than most. \n\n**First IIT-** \n\nGetting into IIT is a matter of hard work. Yes you can be incredibly smart and still get in, but if you work hard, you will surely get in top 1000 rank. \n\nGetting into IIT is also a insurance policy against the IAS failure (will come back to this point later). If you do manage to get into IIT, rest assured you will earn a decent salary and have a decent life. Ofcourse you will always want more - start the next Flipkart, be the next Raghuram Rajan - but if you step back and compare yourself with the general Indian population, you will feel blessed that you got into IIT. \n\nMoreover, if you do get into IIT/NIT/BITS you open up a lot of doors. You want to do an MBA - nothing less than IIM. MS- nothing less than a top US college. The possibilities are endless.\n\n**Now, IAS-** \n\nGetting into IAS is a matter of luck. There are some people who have cleared the exam by brute force of will, hardwork and skill, but these are rare. I have noticed 6 years of candidates and I can name only 2-3 people who truly deserved to clear this exam and who could clear this exam year on year. Most people clear the exam in one year by luck and if they were to write it again, they probably would not. \n\nI personally know a friend who have given the interview 3 times (he is gave the interview this year but result has been put on hold), cleared the mains 4 times. He is really smart and really hardworking. But his luck runs out at some point or the other - his interview went okay once, his one paper was okay once. So, you cant just bank on the exam. \n\nThe exam is very luck based. Kind of an easier version of getting into the Indian cricket team. For every Kohli who has gotten into the team with hard work, there are even more number of people who couldnt get into India-A team, just because of a bad day, bad weather, bad personal situation etc. *I wouldnt advise you to put all your eggs in the IAS basket.*\n\n**My advise to you**\n\nYou should definitely study for IIT now. If you get into any top 50 Engineering college in India, that would be worth it. Even if you fail in UPSC after a couple of attempts, you can give CAT, do an MBA and still have an above average life. This is your insurance which IIT buys. It will buy you peace of mind against the failure of UPSC. \n\nI know of people who gave UPSC for a couple of year, then went to IIM - A/B/C ( that was 2 years of doing nothing but UPSC btw), went to USA for MS, or just joined a job. IIT helps you with this. \n\nAlso know that only IAS, IPS and IFS are worth the effort. IRS is on par with any job that you might get post IIT, and anything else is plain bad. Either no work, or no power, or too much corruption without the power. So, IIT will help you not take these sub-par options (no offence to anyone who is in those services, but that is just a personal opinion). \n\n**So, study for IIT now. Forget about IAS. Get into IIT or any other good engineering college. Then you can start to think about IAS.**', '**IIT** is for engineering.\n\n**IAS** enables you to contribute directly to social upliftment of our country.\n\n**IAS** can be attempted without an IIT degree.\n\nI hope this helps you get some clarity.', ""Just a little confused.

Our families are quite opposite

her younger sister is 20 year old and married, my elder brother is 30 year old and bachelor. (he has no plan of marrying till 35)

Currently I do freelancing for social media marketing and earn $500-2k per month {approx $1k}

we're in relationship for 5 years, we both are kinda shy and sweet. so, we both never had fight with ourselves (or even anyone else as a individual!)

I'm athiest (born hindu) but she is religious and do 5x namaz/day, goes to madarsa but still she is pretty chill and open-minded. I'm into dank memes. she never gets offended in any dark memes of her religion.  (she is unicorn)

Her home is in colony (where her 200-300 relatives lives too). so, there is risk of getting lynched by mob while dropping her or picking her. (because I'm hindu)

&#x200B;

Actually I had no intention of marrying till age 30 but I love her so much that I'm even ready to get circumcision for her. and since she wants to marry. so, offcourse I will. I'm willing to do anything for her.

So, the issue is that my family want me to wait few years but in her family there relatives are recommending her mom to marry her with her cousin. (also, they don't know about our relationship and will definitely be against me)

Yikes bro!\n\nSecondly, as a fellow atheist, it sounds to me like you're prepared to sacrifice a whole lot of your values because you're scared of how religious nuts would react to your decision. While you're prepared to lop body parts off, will the girl be prepared to walk away from her family if they don't accept you? Will she be open to registering a police complaint if they force her in any way? Will she walk out of the colony of relatives and stay with you? Dank memes and all is very good. All that means is that she will show an open mind in private. Coming out in public and going against a community is quite another thing. Please try and make sure you don't skin the pig before you know for sure if the level of commitment is equal both ways. Better play out all these scenarios with her in private before you go public.\n\nThirdly, a personal opinion. Marriage is stupid. I've been with the woman I love for 8 years. We aren't married. If you both want to live together just start living together. Throwing a big party for everyone and binding your loved one in a contractual obligation is not a necessity. If you're already okay rejecting societal norms and following your own logical reasoning, then why stop at atheism? Why not make life even simpler?

231,Non-Political,g59jnx,"Why aren't there movies made about important African (Habshi) figures in Indian history? In general, there seems to be so little discussion of Africans and their important historical role in India.","So, I recently did a TON of research and made a video on a man named Malik Ambar.  He's an Ethiopian slave who became a de facto king in the Deccan and successfully defended his kingdom against Mughal invasion.  What shocked me is how I would not have ever known about his existence if I wasn't already doing a deep-dive into Deccan history.

His narrative is incredible.

This man was sold into slavery by his own parents, then climbed his way to the top of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and led a Deccan resistance movement against the Mughal Empire.  Jahangir was so pissed off that he had a painting commissioned of himself shooting Malik Ambar in the head with an arrow.

Why is there so little interest in the Habshi community and their historical exploits?

I mean, Malik Ambar is not even the only one with an interesting story.  There's the Bijapur minister Ikhlas Khan, there's the Habshis who took over the Bengal Sultanate, the independent Habshi pirates of Janjira Island, and more.

Thoughts?

It struck me as particularly strange, as many African communities in India are treated poorly today.  Seems like if more people knew how intricately tied they are to our histories, there would be more respect.

Plus the fucking failed coverup.\nHow arent they the problem?\n\nIts not racist to call spade a spade.', ""Reality is you can't trust China. Simple."", ' \n\nFor those blocked by paywall:\n\n[**YASMEEN SERHAN**](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/yasmeen-serhan/)\n\nFor much of the world, the coming weeks and months ([if not years](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/)) will be dedicated to curbing the spread of the coronavirus. In China, where the outbreak has purportedly been contained, another challenge is pressing: Damage control.\n\nBeijing has been mounting a diplomatic push to help the world contain the pandemic and, in the process, reposition itself not as the authoritarian power that was slow to sound the alarm on the impending health crisis, but as the global leader that stepped up when [others didn’t](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/trump-threatens-defund-world-health-organization/610030/). In some places, it appears [to](https://shanghaiist.com/2020/03/25/serbian-president-kisses-chinese-flag-after-experts-and-equipment-arriving-from-china/) [be](https://www.lastampa.it/politica/2020/03/24/news/il-pd-attacca-di-maio-troppo-filo-cinese-1.38633410) [working](https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1250608378797326337?s=20).\n\nNot everywhere, though. In India, which this month marked 70 years of diplomatic relations with Beijing, anti-China sentiment has soared. Many Indians fault the country for allowing the virus’s spread, and references to the “Wuhan virus” and “China virus” have become commonplace.\n\nIndia’s perception of China at this moment matters, if for no other reason than to signal how others might be viewing Beijing’s efforts. Like many countries, India doesn’t count China as a key ally, nor does it necessarily have much incentive to praise Beijing for its response to the pandemic so far. India is, however, also among the many countries that have become reliant on China—not just for trade and investment, which was the case before the pandemic, but, perhaps most crucially now, for the vital equipment required to curb the spread of the virus, including testing kits, face masks, and other personal protective gear. That dependence has proved enough to prevent India from openly criticizing China—at least in any official capacity. It hasn’t stopped the Indian public from turning on Beijing, though, nor is it likely to prevent other countries’ populations from doing the same.\n\nIf India proves impervious to its charitable efforts, China might wonder, who else will?\n\nIndia has always had a complicated relationship with its larger neighbor. Though India was the first country in Asia outside the Communist bloc to establish diplomatic ties with the People’s Republic of China, in April 1950, their shared history has been riddled with tensions—not least a war (which China won) and an [unresolved border](https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/05/are-china-and-india-about-to-fight-over-their-border/275518/) dispute in Arunachal Pradesh, Indian’s northeasternmost state. Compounding these divisions are India’s tensions with its bitter rival Pakistan (an ally of China’s) and other long-standing issues such as the status of Kashmir, a disputed territory between India and Pakistan to which China also lays some territorial claim. But India and China also share a number of common interests, including a robust, if [lopsided](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=199141), trading relationship.\n\n“The India-China relationship has had its ups and downs,” Gautam Bambawale, India’s ambassador to China from 2017 to 2018, told me. He noted that officials on both sides tend to describe the relationship as one “where there are elements of both cooperation as well as competition.” Others have described the two countries as “[frenemies](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/world-can-learn-from-frenemies-india-china-akbaruddin/articleshow/63413235.cms).”', 'So in that case the US and Trump should be part of the problem because Trump also played it down, claimed it was a hoax, and just the common flu and would go away by April with warmer weather, and now he is literally instigated rednecks to protest against stay at home orders. What he has done is 10000000000000000 times worse than anything China allegedly did']",0,-1

3. Hair Clippers - To Trim and cut your hair when you are at Home

**Detailed Analysis**

**Beard Trimmer**

**Economy Segment**

[Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Rs 1199 v/s [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Rs 1349

Spec Wise & Price Wise- Mi Trimmer Wins handily 90 Min Run time, 40 lenght settings & IPX 7 Water proof certification v/s 30 min run time & 11 length settings

Product quality wise - Philips is a a little better. the Comb of Mi Trimmer is not as good as Philips and bends a little bit due to which the precision is a little off. When we come to Philips product quality is something which is unmatched

Decision - Mi Trimmer is the smarter buy but Philips is the market leader for a reason. So if you want extreme precision go for Philips, if not go for Mi

**Premium Segment**

[Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \- Rs 1999 Best Personal care product to have been launched last year. As close to a shave as you can get.

Specs are decent 45 min run time but the trim quality is the best I have seen in any trimmer. No competition

**2. Full Body Grooming Kits -**

Philips does not really have a good selection in Grooming Kits

**Economy Segment**

[Beardo All-in-1 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) \- A good Product at a affordable price. - Rs 1299

Decent Specs : 45 min run time & 21 Length settings

5 Attachments - Beard Trimmer, Body Groomer, Nose & Ear Trimmer, Precision Trimmers, Body grooming Comb

No competition in this price range. Product is good reviews are great

**Premium Segment**

[Nova 1153](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3) Rs 1599 v/s [Syska 3052](https://www.flipkart.com/syska-ht3052k-02-runtime-50-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97a98575ca758?pid=TMRFGYCDZ2FA3DFZ) Rs 1599

Similar case as the Trimmer Segment. Nova has great specs 160 min Runtime which is next level while Syska is marginally better in Product Quality and lower in specs 10 length Setting and 50 min run time. No of attachments are same standard ones

My Suggestion is to go for Nova 1153 if pin point accuracy is not required otherwise go for Syska 3052

**Hair Clippers**

Most of the selection is segment is not available right now. The best brand is Wahl but they are not instock right now

[Nova NHT 1083](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) \- Newer Product with decent Specs 120 min run time. 5 Length Settings for hair. Reviews and ratings are good

In the last few days, me and my family have had these curious nocturnal visitors. We initially thought they were some sort of wild cats.

We were to be proved wrong soon enough and we know them as palm civets. Palm civets are a strange bunch of mammals with tails that look like that of the cats. 

We now know that these one of the civets entered our house and crapped all over our kitchen. We initially thought it was a rat until we caught a juvenile palm civet in a trap. I rode to a place full of trees without many people around and released the animal there.

The animal is now separate from its family and probably hiding somewhere. Knowing my parents, they would have had the animal killed merely out of fear. Now, I need to know if I did it right.

But situation as it is, COVID-19 means that I am now in a dilemma because of 2 reasons -

  


1. Most politicians and Economists agree that even after the COVID-19 pandemic is under control, the recession it has started will continue. Does this mean that this is not the best time to be graduating from a business school?

  


2. Due to ban on international travel laid down by most countries, I may not be able to travel and attend classes physically. Being able to immerse myself in a developed Aisan work culture and the ability to network with some.of the best students from all around ASIA is one of the reasons why I am persuing the degree and studying for online while living in India is not worth the money I'll be paying for the MBA for me.

Here's some background information: 

  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 

2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 

3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   


  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   


  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk?

Please know that these conceptions are not universal and do not overlap exactly with American ideas. In many Indian communities, dating is now common in the younger generation, but telling your family about a significant other = an engagement. So in an Indian context, for many people, its putting the cart before the horse to announce the relationship prior to an engagement.  \nIf your relationship is strong in every other way, a reluctance to tell the extended family does not signify a lack of belief in it on her part. Assuming your relationship is in good shape in every other way, she isn\'t ""hiding behind"" Indian culture, she\'s doing her best to balance her family\'s worldview with your worldview, and this takes time and effort. Many people who have to inhabit multiple worlds go through this process. \n\nPerhaps one way to proceed is to get on her team, become her partner and ally in negotiating between cultures. After all, once you marry an Indian, you\'ve joined the wild and subtle dance of inhabiting multiple cultures for life, my friend.  So ask questions, something like:\n\n- What does your family think about X?\n- What can we do to set them at ease about X?\n- How can we communicate to them that XYZ is important to me/us?\n- What is important to them / what are their concerns about X?\n\nGet yourselves on the same team, so that you\'re not another node in the cultural tug-of-war. \n\nOnce more, every person and every relationship is unique, and so is every family, so take my thoughts with a pinch of salt.', 'Dude.

Her reservations about revealing about you to her family could be because of two reasons. Most families here are not very encouraging of love marriages and doubly so when it's interracial. She may be holding off because she doesn't want the extended family making unwanted remarks about her relationship. It is not unusual for the family to reveal to others in the extended family about the relationship only after the wedding dates are set. In a conservative South Indian set up there's only courting no dating. \n\nAlso she may not be very sure of what the future holds especially since you guys may end up living in different cities. And if it doesn't work out, if she has to get an arranged marriage then if her extended family knows about a prior relationship with an American her value in the arranged marriage market goes down."", 'You need to ask yourself this first. Is it really necessary for you to want her extended family to know about you?\nOver here in some conservative communities , extended family will poke their huge noses in EVERY matter. I\'m not exaggerating by any means. It is a nuisance . Imagine them calling you everyday and asking why you don\'t have kids and then making fun of you for not being a ""man"" and earning more than his wife. They will berate you . Your partner is aware of that and is trying to tread carefully here . So understand her side, know that this is a serious situation and give her time to deal with this . Also take some time to brush up on her family politics lol', ""A lot of Indian families are very close knit, children (even after 18) are close with their parents and often support them financially too. Parents too support their children, emotionally and financially.\n\nHere are a few things you need to consider.\n- Find out how close is she to her family\n- How orthodox is her family, immediate most importantly.\n\nIf she's really close and is from an orthodox family, you're definitely in for trouble. Reason being it's quite likely they would want an arrangement within the faith and even possibly the same language. That being said, if she's not really close she may still be okay going against their wishes. But if she is really close, 99% chance she will not go against their wishes."", 'Though you\'ve probably been told this, marrying someone from another country, heck, even just a slightly different community then your own is a HUGE deal in India. Having a job and being independent would give her more standing and give her decisions (like deciding to marry you) more weight and respect in the community. My cousin was dating his gf for about 6 years (who was also from India but from a different state) before he told his parents because he was waiting to get a good job. When I told my parents about my girlfriend who was Indian but was Christian, there were fights and tears for several months and my own mother couldn\'t talk to me for an entire month. This despite the fact that we\'re comparatively a very progressive family, with several relatives including myself living abroad. And all this is exponentially harder for a girl because India is still quite patriarchal and women asserting their independence can cause major freakouts. \n\nSo please realise that this isn\'t about YOU. You don\'t have to convince her of anything or explain to her how important it is to you etc etc. She already knows all these things. And she agrees with all these things. She is on your side. However, the careful manoeuvres required to inform parents and extended family... Leave those decisions to her. She has taken the first steps which is telling her sister and her mother. My guess is her mother is still getting acclimatized to the idea. And before she tells her father she would need her mother\'s support. If mother\'s support is there, even if her father gets upset she (your gf) will have someone on the inside (her mom) to placate him. Otherwise things could get ugly fast. \n\nAgain it\'s not about you at all. It\'s unfortunate that Indian families are like this. But these tight family bonds lead to a much more supportive, connected and loving family structure once all this blows over and you won\'t regret it. It\'s just that some people are old fashioned and need some time to come to terms with big changes. All their life her parents probably had ideas on what her wedding would be like or what kind of groom they will find for her and they have to suddenly make a 180 on the things they\'ve simply believed all their lives.\n\nSimilar issues will arise when her parents want to tell the rest of the family. There are a lot of things they will consider. Things like timing and maybe first slowly introducing the idea that she\'s dating someone without revealing who it is. They may also want to go in person to have this discussion. In the case in my family each move was very carefully planned and we aren\'t even particularly close or dependant on the extended family. \n\nIf you want to make things easier for her, make some efforts to understand her culture. Learn a bit of the language, buy some traditional Indian clothes (with her help!). Read up on Indian history so you better understand the context of some things. And make sure to support her when she starts facing push back (which she 100% will) from her family and extended family. People may say awful things about her to her face, stuff that makes her cry. Your job is NOT to get angry at that moment or say something like ""fuck those guys how dare they say that"" and try and break away from the family. Instead be patient and give it time, lots of time. Be like a river that carves its way through a canyon. Just with patience and time you can win over even the most conservative folks in her family. But she has to be the one taking these decisions on how to move the needle forward. Just trust her and wait. About the job thing, there isn\'t anything extra you can do. She knows it\'s important too, but far more important things are on the line, lifelong family relationships and she definitely has to prioritize that. If she messes it up, both the job and the relationships get fucked. She must be smart enough to know that this stuff is time sensitive, she\'s struggling with these decisions as well. I can\'t imagine there is anything you can tell her she hasn\'t thought of already.', 'I am a guy who is born and bred in [Coimbatore.In](https://Coimbatore.In) the last 4-5 years,i am seeing comparatively a lot more Indian guys/girls are getting married to non indians than ever before.Chill,my only advice is to let her know how much she means to you .Don\'t fret too much about being being accepted to her extended family and let her""the coming out"" part to her.\n\nOne tip is once things get settled ,get a hang of things what you can say or not to say from [her.In](https://her.In) India,typically value if your parents have had a strong and long relationship and fret if you have step moms/dads taking it as a sign of you not being brought up properly or not marriage material.Another one,is fold your hands and greet elders with a ""Vanakkam"" for extra brownie points', ""I'm dating a non-indian so maybe I can offer some perspective.

274,AskIndia,g5cv1j,[Help] Potential SIM swapping/hacking,"Hi /r/india,

I need some quick help. I may be going through a SIM swap/hack, and I need to know if its really happening or I am worrying unnecessarily. 

Yesterday I received an SMS for OTP for an Aadhar card which wasn't mine (the last 4 digits were different). So, I shrugged it off. It didn't occur to me that someone else managed to register my number for their Aadhar.

Today, I received an SMS from Airtel saying that I had requested for a duplicate SIM for my number and I should collect it by contacting local office as xxxx phone number. Only I hadn't. So, I immediately called custom support (had to go through so many hoops, I am kinda angry about that) and asked them about it, and they said that there is no such ongoing SIM change/duplication request for my account and that I needn't worry. On myAirtel app too I don't see any ongoing requests/orders. I tried calling that xxx phone number and it was out of network area.

But I am still on my nerves. How can someone else register my phone number for their Aadhar card? And I don't think it is that likely for Airtel to SMS me about SIM duplication by mistake, and that too the very next day.

Is there something that I am missing? Any recommendations on what I should be doing right now?

Any help is appreciated guys, thanks!

279,Non-Political,g5gmr9,Help with a laptop recommendation?,"I am debating between Asus rog strix g and Lenovo y530

I have couple of questions and doubts.

1. The  strix g I am looking at comes with a 1TB HHD. Does it have M.2 SSD slot  as well so I can add one ssd later? Maybe I will go with a 512GB SSD if  the price drops a little bit.
2. On  Flipkart it says Lenovo y530 has an expandable ram up to 16GB whereas  strix g has 32GB expandable. So, ofcourse I want to buy a future proof  laptop and 32GB sounds way better than 16GB not gonna lie but I am not  sure even that much amount of ram will be useful.
3. Asus  rog strix g doesn't come with a camera. I usually don't use camera in  India but I am going to college outside India and I don't want to carry  an extra accessory with the already heavy laptop. So, I need a camera  inbuilt if at all possible. Lastly,
4. The battery, I don't know which has a better battery.

Which laptop would you suggest I should go for? Some input would be appreciated. Thank you!

I have a proposal I would like to put up for validation, so some of us may be familiar with the term ""Socratic method"", for those who are not, it is the way of teaching where you induce curiosity into the pupil's mind, it works on the assumption that all knowledge is innate within us and just requires to be brought out. I have been an avid practitioner and long time beneficiary of this technique. It has not only helped me learn the oddest of concepts (I am a law student, I have to study a lot of odd bizarre topics) but teach them with success as well.

### Tl;dr

On 31 March, the Foundation for Media Professionals filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis. During the first hearing on 9 April, the Court issued notice to the Standing Counsel for Government of Jammu & Kashmir. The matter was listed again today i.e. 21 April and the Court directed the Government to file a reply to the petition by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March. The petition was first listed for hearing before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J on 9 April. During the hearing on 9 April, the bench issued notice to the Standing Counsel of Government of Jammu & Kashmir. Read more about the petition and last hearing [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/sc-issues-notice-in-fmps-petition-seeking-restoration-of-4g-internet-services-in-jammu-kashmir-during-covid-19-crisis/).

Subsequent to the petition being filed on 31 March, the Government of Jammu & Kashmir continued to direct ISPs to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G through orders issued under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017. These orders issued on 3 April and 15 April were also challenged by the Petitioner by filing additional applications. 

### Practical Impact of the Internet Slowdown

In addition to challenging subsequent internet slowdown orders, the Petitioner also sought to bring on record personal narratives of hardships faced by doctors, teachers, students, journalists, advocates etc in Jammu & Kashmir due to the internet slowdown. FMP’s Director and veteran journalist, Ms. Revati Laul personally spoke to 13 residents of Jammu & Kashmir to collect these narratives.

>*“I have so many patients who are just able to call me this time. I can’t understand what they are trying to tell me exactly...One said,I have pain in the tummy. The tummy is big. It has around 20 organs inside. So then I ask – is it the upper part of the tummy, is it the right side, is it lower? And it becomes very difficult. It’s not possible to accurately pin-point what they’re saying.”* \-Doctor at Srinagar Government Medical College on need for video facilities  
>  
>*“The universities will hold their exams on time. Then no one will speak on our behalf to say to them – oh, there was no 4G, there were no classes. There will only be exams. Did we get any education? Are teachers being sent to our homes? Is there a door to door drive to ensure that students’ education won’t be affected?""* \- Student at Degree College in Bemina

The Petitioner also produced a comparative analysis of web performance at 2G and 4G speed to help the Court fully understand the practical consequences of the internet slowdown. This technical report was authored by Mr. Prateek Waghre, a technologist and policy researcher who had previously also analysed functionality of whitelisted websites in Jammu & Kashmir. The analysis revealed that tasks on observed 2G speed can take upto 50 times longer and 2G network conditions were well below the minimum requirements of video streaming/video communication platforms like YouTube, Zoom and Skype. In addition to this theoretical analysis, Mr. Waghre also carried out a simulated test which found that some interactive interfaces like the World Health Organization’s Situation Tracker did not function at observed 2G speeds at all. 

### What happened at today’s hearing?

During today’s hearing, the bench inquired about a suo moto petition pending before the Jammu & Kashmir High Court on the same issue. In response to this, the Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta indicated that he requires time to seek more information about the suo moto petition and suggested that it may also be transferred to the Supreme Court. 

The Court also sought information about the total number of COVID-19 cases in Jammu & Kashmir. Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi appearing for FMP informed the Court that the region had 354 COVID-19 cases. He emphasized that this was a matter of grave urgency and the Government had not filed its response despite notice being issued on 9 April. Therefore, he requested the Court to direct the Government to file its reply expeditiously.

The Attorney General, Mr. KK Venugopal sought to justify the internet slowdown by claiming that the region had a serious militancy problem. However, the bench directed the Government to file a proper written response and record its submissions on affidavit. The Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta accepted this direction and indicated that the Government will file a consolidated report. 

In addition to FMP’s petition, two more petitions seeking restoration of 4G internet services filed by Soayib Quereshi and Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir were also listed for hearing today. Advocate Charu Ambwani representing the Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir highlighted how the education of 27 lakh students was being hampered because they did not have access to high speed internet. In response to a question by the bench, she also stated that most students in Jammu & Kashmir have laptops and tablets so the biggest hurdle is slow internet speed. 

After hearing submissions made by all counsels, the bench directed the Government to file a reply by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April.

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.

Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 

After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.

Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.

After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.

TLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.

India and UAE share the values  of non-discrimination on any grounds, the Indian ambassador to the  country tweeted on Monday amid growing resentment in the Arab world over  reports of Muslims being targeted in India over the coronavirus  pandemic.

""**India and UAE share the value of non-discrimination on  any grounds. Discrimination is against our moral fabric and the Rule of  law. Indian nationals in the UAE should always remember this**,""  Ambassador Pavan Kapoor.

The  tweets come after a backlash in Arab countries, including UAE and  Kuwait, over instances of Muslims being targeted in India amid the  COVID-19 crisis.

The  Prime Minister's post came on a day when a police case was filed  against a hospital in Uttar Pradesh after it placed an ad in local  papers that it would admit Muslim patients only after COVID-19  screening.

Earlier this month, the Indian government had said that [certain communities and neighbourhoods are being vilified](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-covid-19-do-not-target-any-community-area-for-spread-of-coronavirus-says-centre-2208542)  based on false reports floating on social media and elsewhere, issuing  an advisory to address the social stigma and discrimination surrounding  the COVID-19 pandemic.

The advisory asked people not to spread on  social media the names, identity or the locality of those affected by  the virus or under quarantine. It also urged people to avoid spreading  fear and panic.

The advisory came after a spurt in coronavirus  cases following a religious congregation organised by the Tablighi  Jamaat at its Markaz or headquarters in Delhi's Nizamuddin area, and  instances of people blaming the Muslim community for the spread of the  disease.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4weg2/coronavirus_indian_envoys_tweet_amid_backlash/,[],0,-1

428,Policy/Economy,g5djsa,Unpopular opinion - lockdown extension was uncalled for,"Unpopular opinion, I think this extreme lockdown extension  was uncalled for, ppl who support this extension are like “oh no 20 k ppl infected, 200 ppl have died, if we don’t stop this now by extending this lockdown, lacs of ppl will die!!, so stop cribbing and do your bit! ” 

For comparison in India, 50 lac ppl / children die every year to totally avoidable / curable maladies like typhoid, polio, child malnutrition etc etc 

Destroying an entire countries economy and causing the loss of livelihoods and inadvertently lives coz a few hundred / thousand  ppl who have some serious underlying conditions are gonna die  is not the smartest thing to do ( also over 90% are asymptotmatic as has been proved by Iceland which has conducted tests for like 20% of its population ; asymptotic meaning they don’t show any symptoms and go back to normal without even realizing) 

So again is this extreme step that has totally handicapped our country from ground up even worth it?? 

I mean I am sure soo many ppl would have died as a result of this lockdown itself, ppl who needed medical attention for some other ailment, ppl who couldn’t get their fix ( alcohol etch) ppl who lost their jobs their families and their minds (migrant workers getting screwed over anyone) 

I am not even including the multifold increase of ppl/ children  dying of the aforementioned maladies ( typhoid, polio, child malnutritionetc) that will surely increase by several multiples this year due to the lockdown itself. 

I think the entire thing is a fools errand and with every extension the returns are diminishing . 

As the reality is we might need to extend this lockdown till we get a vaccine in a country like India, as the lockdown by itself can’t curb this menace, and a vaccine might take two years at-least by the looks of it.

Opening shops all over doesn't help prevention of the spread of the virus. E-commerce seems to be the only viable option for now. But the CAIT (confederation of All India Traders) wants a level playing field.

Few days later he is then attacked by goons. Though why two bikers with bottles would try to hurt a Y-security person still remains a mystery. And it's no big deal for BJP to hire Congress goons, ample evidence of it during 2002...

Is it a signal that he has served his purpose and now can be done away with..?
Or has he mistakenly questioned his masters (remember how a while ago godi-media was asking questions to BJP which left them fuming) and the masters want to set an example for everyone by mock-atracking him...
Has he asked too much of a price, we do know he got a shiny new office right after elections..?
Is he trying to garner sympathy coz Maharashtra CM has said that people who are giving undue communal angle to Palghar lynching will be taken to task..?
Talks of defemation preparation by Congress rattling up his nerves... (Remember how he changed tunes after Zakir Naik sent him ₹500crore notice).

No country is in a position to recover from this hit anytime soon and nobody is dreaming of getting back to their last quarter performance anytime in the next five years, except Amazon, maybe.

But I hear people comparing this country's bailout with that country's stimulus package and it's a horrible metric to be judging a country's fiscal astuteness on.

At least right side up.

Turn the metric around. The smaller the amount of money the government prints the better it is for the country. Every country that printed free money went broke. Zimbabwe, Iran, Venezuela, Japan is heading there as we speak. America is going to have to go to war to make up for this hit its economy is going to take, that's a given. Whether it's a literal war or a Trump war is up in the air.

But I digress. The point is, we are in a much better position as an economy to recover hopefully at a safe and healthy rate. As long as we continue to not print any more free money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g6s19w/indias_comparatively_small_package_will_be_its/,['Wow.this is just some fantasy stuff to avoid comparison.I can agree with sentiment to avoid comparison.

835,Policy/Economy,g4s5yd,"Indian govt banning investment from China is yet another ""masterstroke"" by Modi - this time, to kill startups.","Modi is on a killing spree. After killing poor people in DeMo, MSME in GST, now his latest target is Startups. Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government. With economy already slowing down before Covid impact, and now in a state of paralysis, several promising startups will go under water, unless they receive investments. 

China is a key investor in several prominent Indian startups that lot of Indians use, from Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket etc though Chinese holding companies like Alibaba, Tencent etc. [Chinese firms have invested over $4 billion into Indian startups](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-4-billion-chinese-investment-desi-start-ups-wary-of-fdi-policy-tweak/articleshow/75228027.cms). Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. 


After China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation's free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. 



Key question to ask are:

1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. 

2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? 

3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?


Many Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments.

981,AskIndia,g4i22d,why are so many indians and sri lankans so arrogant?,"I know they're not the same but i will just say india instead of saying ""India and sri lanka"" every single time because india is more relevant to my subjective experience and because of simplicity, so im not meaning to offend anybody but i've met people from both bakcgrounds and i like and respect their culture but i've noticed something that i usually ignore unitl it's just too annoying

&#x200B;

So yeah, maybe I don't know so many indians and of course i can't speak for all of them, but literally every single one of the ones i've been exposed to except for mutahar from ""some ordinary gamers"" youtube channel are very arrogant and/or egotistical. For example i've met and talked to or been exposed to people from india or with an indian background on the internet, living in canada, in my country and abroad in other countries in europe and also in china and japan. Oh and of course indian scammers through the phone and in videos (lol).

Some of the things I've noticed a lot is that they will say India is the greatest country ever, better and more powerful than the US, russia and china combined, they will bloat and lie in a ""lie, cheat or steal"" kind of attitude in order to not admit that maybe they are not the best country or that they personally are not the greatest in math or tech in the world.

&#x200B;

Like for example i'm from a third world country and it's okay, got no problem with that. When I went to school a classmate who is from india while in canada kept saying how india is the greatest nation to ever exist and me and a friend just told him that was stupid nationalism and even if it mattered it's obvious india can't be the best at everything because no country can but man was he stubborn about the matter.

&#x200B;

I've noticed many people like for example phone scammers act this way to justify shitty actions, especially against americans, which i mean, yeah, everybody hates americans, i get it, but why make stuff up to justify yourself or why pretend or lie about being better than others?

&#x200B;

Also i've noticed many times that many indians cheat or lie and when caught they will never ever accept it, this happened with some people who stole money from my parents and even on private face to face conversations they acted as if it never happened when everybody involved knows it did, there was no point on lying. Months later that same person asked for money and said he would call the cops because of the illegal practices we did if he didnt have the money. And of course there were no illegal practices, he could've just said he was going to sue us on fake allegations but he chose to flat out lie in a way that even a 5 year old could tell it was a lie. That lie was so stupid that of course the cops never showed up and he never sued us.

&#x200B;

Now don't get me wrong, ive met some really cool indian people, and some of the people that i've seen having this attitude are actually very good people, or at least most of the time, but I just don't get it, everytime i have called on or seen an indian person being called on some arrogant or selfish behaviour they traight up LIE with the worst lies ever, they would make up literally ANYTHING before accepting they may be wrong and not be the best person in the whole planet.

&#x200B;

I just find it interesting that this kind of personalities have been present every single time i have been exposed to indian people. Especially since ive seen a lot of indian people who will cheat or backstab others without remorse and then just lie about it compared to people from other cultures ive met. (ive travelled and lived aborad a lot so indian people are just one of the several cultures ive been exposed to a lot , and this came to my mind after a long time when reading people expressing the same feelings online

&#x200B;

it's like if you get caught pointing a gun to someones head and say ""yeah, it wasn't me, it was someone else"" like dude i saw it was you, did you really think that would change my mind?

&#x200B;

I mean is there a cultural reason behind it?

&#x200B;

Is india a very nationalist country that brainwashes people?

&#x200B;

do indian people live in denial?

&#x200B;

or maybe it's just a huge coincidence? then why am i not the only one who thinks that?

&#x200B;

the best example i can think of is the ""designated pooping street"" meme where some guy tries so hard to make india look like a first world country when it clearly isnt and everybody knows it. Why pretend being someone you're not? as a fellow third world country dweller i just accept my country is great in some aspects and needs huge improvement in others, it's okay

&#x200B;

I just don't get it

&#x200B;

what is your own opinon on it? maybe some of you actually have seen this on your fellow countrymen and actually dont like it? or am projecting a wrongful perception of people from india?

I'd like to know what you guys think :)

&#x200B;

edit: after rereading my post i think i left there a chance to sound like i'm saying all people i know from india are bad people, just in case, it was only a handful of truly bad experiences but the proud/arogant attitude is what i'm asking about, i'm not saying all indians are cheaters or back stabbers, i'm saying that the ones that actually are (like in any culture there will be some) will have this attitude and it's interesting how far they will go to keep a lie or avoid criticism even if it's clear they are wrong. 

Also the good indian people i know may show this arrogant side of them just when talking about countries or politics, not always, of course, i'm not saying it is always a very defining trait of their personality, but a trait that is very common to surface at least once in my own experience.

From what I know, the drug has side-effects and it's efficacy has been contested in several clinical trials. The article mentions that the initial plan of testing 50,000 people has been scaled down and a target group will be identified after recording their medical history and consent for the study.


As a layman, I had the following questions:


- What are the possible side-effects the drug has on an average person with no underlying health conditions?



- Given that even the young residents in slums are more likely to have underlying health conditions due to poor living conditions (quality of water, sanitation etc.), is it more likely that these side effects would affect them adversely? What implications does it have for the results of the experiment, even if it's carried out as planned? (Link to study for this claim [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5141369/))



- Are there any examples of similar clinical trials conducted on a population at this scale elsewhere in the past? From what I know, such trials are usually conducted in clinics at a much smaller scale.



- Thoughts about notion of informed consent for this study under these conditions?

995,Politics,f9outu,Fuck all Religion,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

1057,Non-Political,be5cxk,Unpopular Opinion: Divorce rate in India is less because most women are not financially independent.,"Let's face it, India boasts about its lowest divorce rate in the world, with just 1 percent. 
Only 13 out of 1000 marriages result in a divorce in India.

Let’s see.\n\nMad price discovery mechanisms in big Indian cities like Noida, Mumbai and Delhi.\n\nTo understand what has happened, let’s imagine there is a piece of land somewhere in Noida or Mumbai.\n\n\n\nThere are two parties willing to buy the land - one is a farmer, the other is a property developer.\n\nAs the demand for property in the market is much higher than the demand for food, the property developer is able to pay a higher interest rate to the bank.\xa0In other words, the property developer has a probability of making higher profits from the land than the farmer.\n\nNow, one might say there is nothing wrong here. But to see what’s wrong, we need to ask\xa0Why is the demand of property so high?\n\nThe simple people would say it’s because the population is growing, and land is limited, so the demand for property is high and growing.\n\nBut if you dig deep, you realise there are two reasons the demand of property is high in our country.\xa0Based on the reason causing the demand, we can divide the demand for property into two - the organic demand and the speculation driven demand.\n\nWhen people buy house to live in, it’s organic demand. But\xa0when people buy houses not to live, but to make money, it’s speculation driven demand.\n\nSo the demand for property in big cities of India is not high because people want to live and for that they need houses, the demand for properties is high because people are buying multiple properties to earn money.\n\nLet’s go back to our example - as the demand for property is artificially high, the property developer can make a lot of money from the land.\xa0The banks (or other funds) want to earn money as well, so they give loan not to the farmer, but to the property developer.\n\nThis ruins the economy in multiple ways -\xa0First, it increases the artificial demand for land and property even more, driving the cycle further. Second, it creates supply of things without organic demand. Big buildings are being constructed but the working class of our country can’t afford the houses, specially in big cities.\xa0The law of supply-and-demand has been killed due to the speculation driven artificial liquidity injection.\xa0Third, it increases the wealth gap by boosting asset prices. Forth, because the banks are more willing to fund speculative investments instead of real economic activity, the employment creation is low in the long run. So you see this gap between GDP Growth and employment in India.\xa0Fifth, the Indian banks are dead inside. We will see this in next point.\n\nIndian Banks are toast\n\nGoing back to our example - the bank has now given loan to the property developer. Everything looks fine they will say. What can go wrong?\n\nThe health of the bank look really nice. They have an asset paying them 6%. And in case the property developer fails, the bank can always take over the property and sell it, recovering all the money.\xa0Nothing can go wrong. It’s all safe. Right? NO.\n\nRemember the two types of demand - the organic demand and speculation driven demand.\n\n\n\nSee the cycle described above. You will see why Indian banks are finished. Everything is fine until it’s not.\xa0Suddenly there will be an explosion in the banking system, banks will start failing one after the other.\n\nRemember the high property prices were created by the money injections by the banks (and private funds) themselves.\xa0The banks fund the purchase and development of properties.\n\nIndian banks are already in trouble. This cycle has started, it will take some more time to blow up. You wouldn't see this till it’s too late.\n\n\n\nThat’s why we have unfinished property crisis in big cities, the developers can’t borrow more to finish the development.\n\nWhat do we learn here -\xa0The property prices are not going up because of lack of land or growing population, but due to money being injected into the system by reckless banks.\n\nHow careless banks created the job crisis of India - why India can’t create massive scale, permanent good paying jobs for its youth.\n\nLet’s go back to our example. The farmer was unable to get the loan and land not because what he was doing was useless, it was because his industry didn’t had a banking system and speculative investors creating artificial demand.\n\nIf he owned the land, he would be producing food for the people living in the area. Not only did the bank’s and investors’ careless practices increased the housing and land prices in the area, it also kicked out the other productive people and entrepreneurs from the locality.\n\nIn an ideal case, the bank should be lending to various sectors of the economy. This would increase production of useful goods and services and increase the prosperity of the locality.\n\nBut because of the bank’s incentive to earn a lot of money, they give a lot of loan to a few people, in a few cities, in a few industries. This increase wealth inequality.\n\nSo the farmer that could have created a good agri business and good productive jobs for a lot of people is now himself working as a real-estate agent.\n\nAnd what happens when the property bubble goes bust? The people working in the industry will lose jobs. All the workers, labourers, will be out of work.\n\nSo the banks are, instead of creating long term productive jobs, funding the creation of temporary jobs in speculative industries, while harming entrepreneurs by increasing the cost of borrowing and running a business.\n\nSo you see the GDP is going up, Sensex is up but employment is not.\n\nWhy government is pushing for a cashless economy?\n\nCause the banks are toast. As soon as banking system goes down, everyone will start pulling cash out of the bank, creating what we call a “bank run”.\nBank’s don’t have the cash to pay everyone, cause they give out the cash in loans. They take deposits from you, keep a tiny part of it as reserves and give out the rest as loans.\n\nSo if everyone starts pulling out their money from the bank all at once, banks will explode, as they don’t have money.\n\nThe solution? Cashless economy !\n\nDid you notice,\xa0there is no way for someone to get out of the banking system in a 100% cashless economy.Your money will always be in the banking system. Money can only move from one account to another. You can never pull your money out of the banking system.\n\nModi is pushing for a cashless economy to keep you trapped in the banking system.\xa0The banking system is dead inside and needs your money to survive.\n\nDemonetisation was done to push the money outside the banking system into the system. Demonetisation was done to protect the banks.\n\n\n\nGovernment’s Big Scam - The taxpayer bailout of careless rich people\n\n\n\nThe Modi government is using your tax money to bail-out the careless banks, private investors and rich big-city home buyers.\n\nIt’s a scam.

1182,Non-Political,7xqpyb,Hi r/India! I wanted to share this piece I finished this morning of my granduncle in Punjab,,https://i.imgur.com/qvl8o1p.jpg,"['""Beyond every bend""\noil on canvas\n36""x36""\n\nThis is painting of my granduncle who I visit almost every year in India. He has always been a very cheerful and jolly man, almost like my own santa growing up.  During my recent visit in 2016, he was not the same.  He would often come around the village with his grandchildren around his shoulders. This time I would go to visit him, in a small room on the side of the road. The room was connected to the larger family house but there was a sense of isolation and exclusion there. \n\nI think he was alone, away from his family. He had lost about 50 lbs and was not able to communicate any sort of happy expression. He sat up when he saw me but deep down, there was an underlying loneliness I could relate to. It was almost like he was just waiting for the end.\n\nI can relate to that deep sense of not belonging and often try to communicate it through some of my portraiture. It is in many ways baffling to me how we can be moving inward together, at the same time, not knowing we are not going through it alone.  Unfortunately, I feel at times my culture has been a factor in that. Things are often unsaid and misunderstood. I\'ve grown up not knowing how to express internal conflict and struggle because it just wasn\'t something practiced at the family table. Eventually I would like to create enough work for exhibits and to bring some light to issues of mental health to the general public but also to my own culture.   \n\nThe goal of the painting was to portray the overall mood so I started the painting with a large brush to cover the initial layer. 99% of the painting after that was in palette knife. The knife allows me to create movement, texture, and atmosphere in a few sessions instead of having to layer with a brush.', ""I don't know why but this reminds me so much of [this image](http://www.culturalindia.net/iliimages/Bhagat-Singh-ili-24-img-5.jpg) of Bhagat Singh"", 'Always loved the Punjabi getup and persona, your granduncle and your painting really personified both!

Uber, Ola: No way to contact customer service directly, have to submit ticket and wait for them to call you. The drivers are all corrupt, 8/10 (bangalore) they will call you up to ask for your destination (which they are not supposed to know) then if they dont like it or if you refuse to tell them they will waste your time sitting in some gully trying to force you to cancel.

Pizza hut, dominos, other international chains: Completely 100% indianized, only chicken (religous issue? even UAE pizza hut has pork on their menu), KFC removes fries from its menu (but they sell burgers, wtf? and fries are known, world around, to be the highest margin fast food item).

Electricians, handymen, plumbers: never on time, show up whenever they want, get upset when you say you are now busy. Cant install taps correctly (hot is cold, cold is hot), too near the sink so to get water on your hands you have to touch the sink, poor earthing.

ISPs: shit customer service all-round, high speed, yes, but poor connections with high latency, blocking of websites (disgusting to freedom of information)

Mobile service providers: cheap AF, completely overbooked, infrastructure cant cater to the number of people they take on, get 0.2mbps 4g in metros like mg road bangalore even at 2 o clock on a weekday night.

Autos: meter is just for show, at least in bangalore, aggressive, misbehaved if you dont haggle with them off the meter. Dont even know the roads properly.

According to an ANI report, the Bengaluru Police later announced a reward for the policeman for making way for an ambulance during the convoy movement of President Pranab Mukherjee, who was in the city for the inauguration of Metro’s Green Line.\n\nMukherjee’s convoy was headed towards the Raj Bhavan when Nijalingappa is said to have spotted an ambulance trying to make its a way towards a private hospital near HAL. The sub-inspector directed his colleagues to help the ambulance travel through the traffic-heavy road.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic East Division, Bengaluru City, Abhei Goyal later took to Twitter to praise the officer’s presence of mind.\n\nPSI Sh Nijlingappa is rewarded for deftly allowing the ambulance before the 1st citizen of India. @blrcitytraffic gives way to ??, do you? pic.twitter.com/KoI2nap14N — DCP Traffic East (@DCPTrEastBCP) June 18, 2017\n\nPraveen Sood, the Commissioner of Police, tweeted, “The policeman who took such initiative to be rewarded.

1280,Non-Political,87f85p,My relatives visited me. And I live with my girlfriend unbeknownst to them. And they lost their shit. And it was a thing of beauty. (Re-posting because violated some rules earlier),"Backstory: Last week I broke my ankle and there's a cast around it.  
And also, I tend to be one of the lucky guys in India who lives with his girlfriend. But also unlucky in the sense that a handful of my relatives also live in Delhi.

Here's a highlight of how my last 5 days have been when they visited

* Initially I had to endure gasps, shudders and shivers of them when they realize about my ""Living arrangement"" and how ""apposit Jendaars"" are not supposed to live together.

* Then I experienced a satisfaction almost equal to 1/10th of an orgasm when I saw their faces while they ""inform"" my dad(who couldn't give two shits about it. He's cool like that.)

* Then some other bullshit was uttered around me about homeopathy, patanjali or some pehelwan in some gali or chowk who can cure me within a minute.

* Then came a 2nd wave of gasps and horrific squeals when they realized there is no temple or statue at home.

* In the evening my girlfriend comes from work, so naturally my relatives **HAD** to know what her parents do, earn, spend, overpronate, underpronate???

* Then when they were checking out the rest of the house and saw that the bedroom is being shared (and this is the best part) they acted as if I've murdered their children.

* My bua also got disgusted when she found out I was washing both of ours clothes as it is *ladies* work (This is the only time I was legit pissed) 

* My gf has a full sleeve tattoo for which my maami had a questionnaire ready

* Honb'l mention- It was Navratri and the maid had prepared chicken and rice in Lunch so that was fun.

* Another honb'l mention: All of them know that I drink. Because I got many of my cousins drunk in a family wedding some years back. But when they found the bottles and asked me whether she drinks or not and when I said yes she does. Their immediate response was *But girls can't drink.*  
As if it's anatomically impossible for chicks to drink alcohol.

And I am 24 btw. Just for perspective for how ridiculous they are.

Also my mom told me last night that she got a call from everyone saying  ""*Ladka bohot open ho gaya hai.

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way

* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.

* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans.

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries.

>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

If found eligible, all such future migrants shall also get Indian citizenship, irrespective of their numbers or religion.

Wouldn't a lot of people be eligible at least to acquire citizenship by naturalization? As far as I know, the 1955 act applies to every person irrespective of their religion. Only the CAA lays out a special condition for non-muslim migrants from three countries, that of a reduced time (five years) to be eligible for naturalization.\n\nThe purpose of the NRC would be to make sure that everybody tagged as an Indian citizen has the documented proofs that establishes at least one of the four principal requirements under the 1955 act, namely Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization.\n\nFor example, one of the proofs would be something that can establish that you have been a resident of India for 12 years, so that you're eligible for citizenship by naturalization. My understanding is that it's not that hard to demonstrate that you have been resident in India for twelve years for most people.\n\nIt might be hard for the homeless but wouldn't that be a problem for everybody? Including non-muslims who aren't migrants? Because the CAA only applies to non-muslims **who are also** migrants from those three countries and have been a resident of India since at least 31 December 2014.\n\nAnd even if you don't have documented proof there are other provisions [such as  witnesses or local proofs supported by members of the community, as clarified by the MHA Spokesperson yesterday](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-indian-will-have-to-prove-ancestry-common-documents-will-be-enough-mha-1630201-2019-12-20).\n\nI think that people might be confusing the Assam NRC process for the one that will be implemented nationwide. The Assam NRC guidelines were laid out by the Supreme Court in 2015 specifically for Assam and as of today no official guideline, or process or procedure exists for the nationwide NRC exercise.\n\nSo I'm not sure if it's right to be jumping to conclusions if we don't even know what the nationwide NRC exercise will look like."", ""You need to specify your country of origin for getting citizenship under CAB, isn't it ?""]",0,-1

1331,AskIndia,e69fln,Possible scam on the huge Youtube tech channel PhoneRadar. I am the winner. Need advice,"Hello everyone,

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)

My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 

Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 

Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now.

1344,Policy/Economy,8k08vv,"I made 13 illegal toll booth vanish overnight, milking 3-4 lakhs everyday, using RTI","For decades traveling from native village to the railway station I had been paying toll to cross a bridge, that only kelp on increasing year after year. There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. 

So I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.

Fun Fact: 

* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.
* 3. I happen to meet someone who bragged about his uncle being the toll collector for toll station I had filed RTI, while this whole thing was going on.

1369,AskIndia,b0gd70,Does my period really makes me impure?,"I despise my periods not because they hurt me, but because of the amount of crappy rules I'm made to follow. It's unbelievable that people find it so hard to move on with time. If anyone of you have seen the movie padman, you know what I'm talking about. 

I am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.

It's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. 

Does my period really make me so impure?

1379,Non-Political,ciddbn,I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

Bro, I started my PhD at 27 - two students I met in my cohort 1. An American African woman aged 41 2. A White gentleman aged 55 who had just retired from American Army. These two were older that most of the cohort which was by average 35 years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the PhD cohort. PhD cohort's have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go, especially the econometrics paper. While the lady was not that good at maths, she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper. They outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects. I ended up being really good friends with both of them. In fact they are the closest friends I have on campus. So no, age is honestly a number and nothing else - fight the good fight!  \n\n\nIf you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out - please reach out to me! This was actually my last summer break here in the country and I will be in Philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything I can help you with - please reach out! I am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country.   \n\nAnd again - fight the good fight, I am sure you will do great.   \nI leave you with a song that I used to listen to when I got depressed in JU about my career trajectory. The song was an anthem for us dropouts - Pulak da wrote the song. Pulak da was from Philosophy department and died in a road accident.

The axis of rotation of earth is tilted by 23.5 degrees with respect to a perpendicular to this plane(or one can say the angle between the equatorial plane of earth and the elliptical plane through which it revolves around sun) . Imagine a snapshot where earth is (tilted towards right) on far left of sun. Due to the tilt, the northern hemisphere is closer towards the sun than the souther hemisphere leading to a summer in the northern and winter in the southern. This position of far left is called as the summer solstice (wrt northern hemisphere). Yes , the position on the far right is called as winter solstice. As earth revolves around sun there comes another position which is in between the two solstices, called as an equinox where a person standing at the equator will have the sun exactly above his/her head in the noon. This day is also called as a no shadow day for the equator. I,e, if a vertical body (with almost no width) is kept in the noon , you won't be able to see its shadow(theoretically). Such a no shadow day occurs only twice in a year for a location in between 23.5 deg North and 23.5 deg South latitudes. There are no no shadow days   beyond those latitudes. The day of no shadow for the equator is termed as an equinox. \n\nPS: The equator does not pass through India , therefore today is not a no shadow day for us.

The main camps were deeper in POK around (12-20km) Those pigs who escaped the first onslaught were then painstakingly tracked through drones/comms to well disguised newly erected made shift launching pads. IA decided to share their movements over the last days with PMO. With the porkis playing cry baby and playa hating on the international forum, IA/PMO decided that this message should be made loud and clear.\n\nA platoon of Paras went in silent, HAHO from well inside our territory. Their target was 3 launching pads deeper into POK, around 2-3km in. These were the larger groups, around 12 pigs at each site. Paras wasted them quietly, they didn't know what hit em, they wasted the sentries with silenced sniper shots and most were slaughtered in their sleep.. Ghataks from Dogra and Bihar opened up fire on the posts near 3 launching pads closer to the LOC (around 600m-1.2km in), the adjoining posts were destroyed rapidly :shoot:, this is where around 6-12 PA manning the posts were killed, Porkis only claim 2 PA killed, bet its 2 bodies they could recover, the rest would have been mulch.\nAfter turning the posts to rubble, Ghataks crossed over and destroyed the 3 launching pads where they killed smaller fidayeen squads of around 6 terrorists each. Ghataks went in loud, watching them close in with heavy fire at the 3rd launching pad, it appears one of the pigs blew himself up taking half his squad with him. :rofl:The death toll inflicted by the Ghataks is not clear because they used volleys from grenade launchers, RPO flame thrower, carl gustaf. A Ghatak got close enough to stab 2 bunched pigs with his bare hands.\n\nWhile the op was coming to a close, it appears a couple of truck loads of SSG BATs & Rangers were sent in for reinforcements but when they arrived and saw the volume of fire coming from the Ghataks, they got back in their trucks and ran. Ghataks then covered the Para's egress back.\n\nFinal, estimate of toll is between 60-70 killed including at least 6-12 PA.\n\nI am glad they decided to make it public. Paltan ki ijjat especially for Bihar and Dogra restored, they will however keep a low profile because there was nothing surgical about their role. Their role was much more akin to a hammer coming down hard. My family member says that the sheer speed and brute force of Ghataks in their role was some of the most beautiful IR drone footage caught in his recent memory.
